No I can't forget this evening or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile, but in your eyes
Your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows
No I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't give
I can't give anymore
Well, I can't forget this evening or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile, but in your eyes
Your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
No no no no I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
I can't live

Treated me kind Sweet destiny
Carried me through desperations
To the one that was waiting for me
It took so long Still I believed
Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given
to me Prayed through the nights
Felt so alone
Suffered from alienation
Carried the weight on my own
Had to be strong So I believed
And now I know I've succeeded
In fiding the place I conceived
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given
to me I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given
to me I've realized the dream
And I visualized the love that
came to be i'm so alive
I'm so thankful that I've received
The answer that heaven has sent
down to me treated me kind
Sweet destiny
And I'll be eternally grateful
Prayed through the nights
So faithfully faithfully
Knowing the one that I needed
Would find me eventually
I had a vision of love

I had a vision of love

that you turn out to be

It wasn't raining yet
But it was a little misty on
That warm November night
My heart was pounding
My inner voice resounding
Begging me to turn away
But I just had to see your face
To feel alive
And then you casually walked into the room
And I was twisted in the web
Of my desire for you
(And I was twisted)
My apprehension blew away
I only wanted you
To taste my sadness
As you kissed me in the dark

Everytime I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night

And so we finished the Moet and
started feeling liberated
And I surrendered as you took me
In your arms
I was so caught up in the moment
I couldn't bear to let you go yet
So I threw caution to the wind
And started listening to my longing heart
And then you softly pressed your lips to mine
And feelings surfaced I'd suppressed
For such a long time
(And I was lifted)
And for a while I forgot
The sorrow and the pain
And melted with you as we stood
There in the rain

Everytime I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
Everytime I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night

Last night I dreamed that I
Whispered the words I love you
And touched you so very
Subtly as we were kissing goodbye
(Pretty baby- How I'm missing you)

Everytime I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
(Envision you caressing me)
And go back in time
(I go back)
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
(On the roof that rainy night)

Everytime I feel the need
(When I feel the need)
I envision you caressing me
(I envision you over and over and over again)
And go back in time
(I go back)
To relieve the splendor of you and I
(It was oh so sweet you and I)
On the rooftop that rainy night
(On that rainy night)

Everytime I feel the need
(Last night I had the strangest dream...)
I envision you caressing me
(It actually quite symbolic)
And go back in time
(As I whispered...that I loved you)
To relieve the splendor of you and I
(...very subtly)

Everytime I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night

Sorry I never told you
All I wanted to say
And now it's
too late to hold you
'Cause you've flown away
So far away
Never had I imagined
Living without your smile
Feeling
and knowing you hear me
It keeps me alive
Alive
And I know you're shining down
on me from Heaven
Like so many friends
we've lost along the way
And I know eventually
we'll be together
One sweet day
Eventually
we'll sing in heaven
Darling I never showed you
Assumed you'd always be there
But I I took your presence
for granted
But I always cared
And I miss the love we shared
And I know you're shining down
on me from Heaven
Like so many friends
we've lost along the way
And I know eventually
we'll be together
One sweet day
Eventually
we'll sing in heaven
Although the sun will
never shine the same
I'll always
look to a brighter day
Lord I know
when I lay me down to sleep
You will always
listen as I pray
And I know you're shining
down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends
we've lost along the way
And I know eventually
we'll be together
One sweet day
And I know you're shining
down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends
we've lost along the way
And I know eventually
we'll be together
One sweet day
Eventually
we'll sing in heaven
Sorry I never told you
All I wanted to say

I won't
See your smile
And I won't hear you laugh anymore
Every night
I won't see you walk through that door
'Cause time wasn't on your side
It isn't right
I can't say I love you
It's too late to tell you
But I really need you to know, oh baby
No, I'll never forget you
I'll never let you out of my heart
You will always be here with me
I'll hold on to the memories baby
Baby, can you hear me
Wherever you may be tonight
Are you near me
I need you to be by my side
'Cause I never said goodbye
It isn't right
I should have said I love you
Why didn't I just tell you
God knows I need you to know, oh baby
No, I'll never forget you
I'll never let you out of my heart
You will always be here with me
I'll hold on to the memories baby
Somewhere
I know you'll be with me
Someday
In another time
But right now you're gone
You've just vanished away
But I'll never leave you behind
No, I'll never forget you
I'll never let you out of my heart
You will always be here with me
I'll hold on to the memories
You will always be dear to me baby
No, I'll never forget you
I'll never let you out of my heart
You will always be here with me
I'll hold on to the memories
No, I'll never forget you
I'll never let you out of my heart

I am thinking of you
In my sleepless solitude tonight
If it's wrong to love you
Then my heart just won't
let me be right
Cause I've drowned in you
And I won't pull through
Without you by my side
I'd give my all to have
just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
your body next to mine
Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory
of your song
I'd give my all for your
love tonight
Baby can you feel me
Imagining I'm looking
in your eyes
I can see you clearly
Vividly emblazoned in my mind
And yet you're just so far
like a distant star
I'm wishing on tonight
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
your body next to mine
Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory
of your song
I'd give my all for your
love tonight

I'd give my all to have
just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
your body next to mine
Cause I can't go on
living in the memory
of your song
I'd give my all for your
love tonight
Give my all for your
love tonight

When I am lost
You shine a light for me and set me free
When I am low
You wash away my tears
And take me through
The loneliness
And emptiness
Through the darkest night
Somehow I survive
Through it all
When you tell me I'm the only one you need
Sweet and tenderly
And your love
Breaks away the clouds surroundin' me
All I have I want to give to thee
If I should fall
Your love is strong enough to lift me up
If I'm afraid
You chase away my fears
And take me to
A brighter place
Beyond the rain
And I feel alright
Because you're by my side
Through it all
When you tell me I'm the only one you need
Sweet and tenderly
And your love
Breaks away the clouds surrounding me
All I have I want to give to thee
You take me through
The loneliness and the emptiness
And I feel alright
'Cause you're by my side
Through it all
You tell me I'm the only one you need
Sweet and tenderly
And your love
Just breaks away the clouds surrounding me
And baby all I have I want to give to thee
Want to give you all of my love
Now and forever my love
All I have I want to give to thee

There's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
It's a long road
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand
For you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself
And that emptiness you felt
Will disappear
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you, oh, oh
Lord knows
Dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone
Tear them away, hey yeah
Hold on
There will be tomorrow
In time you'll find the way
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you
Mmm, that a hero lies in you

It was twilight
On the Fourth of July
Sparkling colors were
Strewn across the sky
And we sat close enough
That we just barely touched
While roman candles
Went soaring above us and baby
Then you put your hand in mine
And we wandered away
I was trembling inside
But I wanted to stay
Pressed against you there
and leave the world behind
On that Fourth of July
So starry eyed
On the flowery hillside
Breathless and fervid
Amid the dandelions
As it swept over me
Like the wind trough the trees
I felt you sigh with a
Sweet intensity and baby
Then you put your hand in mine
And we floated away
Delicately lay entwined
In an intimate daze
A crescent moon began to shine
And I wanted to stay
Tangled up with you among
the fireflies
On that Fourth of July
Thunder clouds Hung around
So threateningly
Ominously hovering And the sky
Opened wide Showering
Then you put your hand in mine
And we ran from the rain
Tentatively kissed goodnight
And went our separate ways
And I've never truly felt
the way that I
Felt the Fourth of July
Truly I have never felt
the same inside
Like that Fourth of July
Truly I could never feel
the same as I
Felt that Fourth of July

Oh when you walk by every night

Talking sweet and looking fine

I get kind of hectic inside

Oh baby I'm so into you

Darling if you only knew

All the things that flow through my mind

But it's just a



Sweet sweet fantasy baby

When I close my eyes

You come and take me

On and on and on

It's so deep in my daydreams

But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby



Images of rapture

Creep into me slowly

As you're going to my head

And my heart beats faster

When you take me over

Time and time and time again

But it's just a



Sweet sweet fantasy baby

When I close my eyes

You come and take me

On and on and on

It's so deep in my daydreams

But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby



Sweet sweet fantasy baby

When I close my eyes

You come and take me

On and on and on

It's so deep in my daydreams

But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby



I'm in heaven

With my boyfriend

My laughing boyfriend

There's no beginning and there is no end

Feels like I'm dreaming but I'm not sleeping



It's just a

Sweet sweet fantasy baby

When I close my eyes

You come and take me

On and on and on

It's so deep in my daydreams

But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby



Sweet sweet fantasy baby

When I close my eyes

You come and take me

On and on and on

It's so deep in my daydreams

But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby



Sweet sweet fantasy baby

Sweet sweet fantasy baby

Baby don't tell me
You miss me
You love me
Don't whisper gently
That you can't forget me
Tonight tonight
Cause I've heard it all before
Just turn away
Don't play that game
Baby I don't want to anymore
Let it all
Fade away
Don't you know the love is gone
It's too late
Everything fades away
Nothing ever stays the same
Baby
Don't tell me
You're sorry you hurt me
How many times can I give in
How many battles can you win
Oh don't beg for mercy
Tonight tonight
Cause I can't take anymore
Just turn around

Baby I don't love you like before
Let it all
Fade away
Don't you know the love is gone

Nothing ever stays the same
It's so hard for me
To let you go
Don't leave me standing in the cold
Oh baby give it one more change
I know that we can make it last
Just let me love you one more time
Cause I don't want to lose my mind
It's so hard for me to let you go
It's so hard for me to let you go
Let it all
Fade away
love is gone
It's too late
Everything fades away
Nothing ever stays the same
Nothing ever stays the same
Let it all
Fade away
love is gone
It's too late
Everything fades away

I just want someone to belong to everyday of my life
Always
So come and take me away
Dream lover come rescue me
Take me up take me down

I was wayward child
With the weight of the world
That I held deep inside
Life was a winding road
And I learned many things
Little ones shouldn't know
But I closed my eyes
Steadied my feet on the ground
Raised my head to the sky
And though time's rolled by
Still feel like that child
As I look at the moon
Maybe I grew up
A little too soon

Funny how one can learn
To grow numb to the madness
And block it away
I left the worst unsaid
Let it all dissipate
And I try to forget
But I closed my eyes
Steadied my feet on the ground
Raised my head to the sky
And though time's rolled by
Still feel like that child
As I look at the moon
Maybe I grew up
A little too soon

Nearing the edge
Obvious I almost
Fell right over
A part of me
Will never be quite able
To feel stable
That woman child falling inside
Was on the verge of fading
Thankfully I
Woke up in time

Guardian angel I
Sail away on an ocean
With you by my side
Orange clouds roll by
They burn into your image
And you're still alive
But I closed my eyes
Steadied my feet on the ground
Raise my head to the sky
And though time's rolls by
Still feel like that child
As I look at the moon
Maybe I grew up
A little too soon

When you love someone so deeply
They become your life
It's easy to succumb to over
whelming fears inside
Blindly I imagined I could
Keep your under glass
Now I understand to hold you
I must open up my hands
And watch you rise
Spread you wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly
I have learned that beauty
Has to flourish in the light
Wild horses run unbridled
Or their spirit dies
You have given me the courage
To be all that I can
And truly feel your heart
will lead you back to me when you're
when you're ready to land
Spread you wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly Butterfly
I can't pretend these tears
Aren't over flowing steadily
I can't prevent this hurt from
Almost overt aking me
But I will stand and say goodbye
stand say goodbye
For you'll never be mine
Until you know the way it
feels to fly
Spread you wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
I will know your mind
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly
Spread you wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly
So flutter through the sky
butterfly
fly
spread your wings and fly
Butterfly

[Layzie Bone]
Don't Breakdown yet it's over, over
Don't Breakdown yet it's over, over
Don't Breakdown yet it's over, over
Don't Breakdown yet it's over
[Krayzie Bone (1)]
(Mariah Carey humming in background)
Steady breaking me on down
Break breakdown
Steady breaking me on down
Break breakdown
Steady breaking me on down
[Mariah Carey]
You called yesterday
To basically say
That you care for me but
That you're just not in love
Immediately I pretended to be
Feeling similarly
In that you'd ever leave
I was ok to just walk away from the
One thing that's unyielding and sacred to me
[Chorus: sung by Mariah Carey; Krayzie Bone singing 1 in background]
Well I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm
Slowly losing my mind
Underneath the guise of smile
Gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel
And I lie convincingly
Cause I don't want to reveal
The fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise
Til I go home at night
And turn down all the lights
And then I breakdown and cry
[Mariah Carey]
So what do you do when
Somebody you're so devoted to
Suddenly just stops loving you
And it seems they haven't got a clue
Of the pain that rejection is putting you through
Do you cling to your pride
And sing 'I Will Survive'
(Krayzie Bone in background: Gotta get control and roll roll roll on)
Do you lash out and say
How dare you leave this way
Do you hold in vain
As they just slip away
[Chorus]
[Wish Bone]
Gonna break you down, down, down, only if you let it (Don't let it)
Everyday crazy situations rocking my mind trying to break me down
But I won't let it forget it
If you feel the same way that I do
Then let me hear y'all all sing too
Sing, it's al-right, it's alright, it's alright yeah
Hoping for the sun, but it looks like rain
B-O-N-E, but it's still the same
Came this far, but it's been a long road
Troubles gonna come but we gotta stay strong, hold on, on
[Krayzie Bone]
Aw, yeah, I often feel the pressures, y'all
But nevertheless Krayzie won't fall
It's over, it's ending here, here
I said it's over. It's ending here, here
So I'll be on my way
And maybe we can meet up in the future one day
But for now I'm bailing, bailing
Bailing!, baby gotta get up, can't take no more
I'm headed for the door
Come and take a look into this humble eye
Tell me if we lived a lie
Would I, should you now
[Layzie Bone]
Every new day is a test for me
So I just pray to the Lord for him to bless me, please
There's struggles I'm going through lately
Breaks me down, set me free
Let me be, let me be
Who else do we have to rely on
Whose shoulder can a thug go cry on
Can't forget my Bible
While you look into my eyes
Won't underestimate this soldier story
I'ma tell you right now I'ma stand up
Wrong if I let my lead bust
Pac said keep your head up
Don't let this world get the best of you
All my struggles, I'm through
If it's over, over, over
Don't breakdown yet it's over
[Chorus]
(with Mariah Carey singing in background)
[Chorus]
(With Mariah Carey singing and Krayzie Bone singing 1 all in background)
Cry, cry (Break break down)
Cry, cry (Steady breaking me on down)
Cry, cry (Break break down)
Cry, cry (Steady breaking me on down)

If you're lonely
And need a friend
And troubles seem like
They never end
Just remember to keep the faith
And love will be there to light the way
Anytime you need a friend
I will be here
You'll never be alone again
So don't you fear
Even if you're miles away
I'm by your side
So don't you ever be lonely
Love will make it alright
When the shadows are closing in
And your spirit diminishing
Just remember you're not alone
And love will be there
To guide you home
Anytime you need a friend
I will be here
You'll never be alone again
So don't you fear
Even if you're miles away
I'm by your side
So don't you ever be lonely
Love will make it alright
If you just believe in me
I will love you endlessly
Take my hand
Take me into your heart
I'll be there forever baby
I won't let go
I'll never let go
Anytime you need a friend
I will be here
You'll never be alone again
So don't you fear
Even if you're miles away
I'm by your side
So don't you ever be lonely
It's alright
It's alright, it's alright
Yes, you know it's alright
Oh, don't ever feel it
Oh, I'm by your side don't you ever be lonely
Yeah, anytime
Oh, you'll never be alone

It's 2 11 and I'm stressing
Watching Tv in my hotel suite
I check my service
every second
At 2 10 you still hadn't
called me
So I'm gonna leave
my cell phone turned on
in my purse by the bed
And before I fall asleep
I guess I'll just check
my machine
Again and again because I'm
Obsessing on you
I wanna be your babydoll
Wrap me up nice and tight
Love me through the night
Come lay me down
Enfold me in your arms
Cover me with velvet kisses
Rock me on and on
And whisper softly to me
You wanna be my babydoll
Zoning out thinking about
You and me between the sheets
I want to get intimate
But you're not within
my reach
So I'll have a
little more wine
And I'll try to drink you
Out of my head
And I'll lay awake awhile
'Til I'm high enough I can
Forget about you until
I wake up again
I wanna be your babydoll
Wrap me up nice and tight
Love me through the night
Come lay me down
Enfold me in your arms
Cover me with velvet kisses
Rock me on and on
And whisper softly to me
You wanna be my babydoll
Slipping into dreams
I feel my love surround you
my subconscious seems
To weave itself around you
Do you care for me
Beyond idolization
Tell me how you feel
But don't keep me at bay
Cause I won't be waiting long
I wanna be your babydoll
Wrap me up nice and tight
Love me through the night
Come lay me down
Enfold me in your arms
Cover me with velvet kisses
Rock me on and on
And whisper softly to me
You wanna be my babydoll
I wanna be your babydoll
Wrap me up nice and tight
Love me through the night
Come lay me down
Enfold me in your arms
Cover me with velvet kisses
Rock me on and on
And whisper softly to me
You wanna be my babydoll
my babydoll
Rock me on on and on

I wanna be your babydoll

I wanna be your babydoll

I wanna be your babydoll

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
Yeah
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need (and I)
Don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking there upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy with a toy on Christmas Day
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, baby
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow (and I)
I'm just gonna keep on waiting underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it to the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to hear those magic reindeer click
'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Oh, baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby
Oh-oh, all the lights are shining so brightly everywhere (so brightly, baby)
And the sound of children's laughter fills the air (oh, oh, yeah)
And everyone is singing (oh, yeah)
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? (Yeah, oh)
Won't you please bring my baby to me?
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just wanna see my baby standing right outside my door
Oh, I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Oh, baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas (all I really want) is you, baby
All I want (I want) for Christmas (all I really want) is you, baby
(Christmas)
The snow's coming down
(Christmas)
I'm watching it fall
(Christmas)
Lots of people around
(Christmas)
Baby please come home
(Christmas)
The church bells in town
(Christmas)
All ringing in song
(Christmas)
Full of happy sounds
(Christmas)
Baby please come home
They're singing ＂Deck The Halls＂
But it's not like Christmas at all
Cuz I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year
(Christmas)
Pretty lights on the tree
(Christmas)
I'm watching them shine
(Christmas)
You should be here with me
(Christmas)
Baby please come home

They're singing ＂Deck The Halls＂
But it's not like Christmas at all
Cuz I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year
(Christmas)
If there was a way
(Christmas)
I'd hold back this tear
(Christmas)
But it's Christmas day
(Please) Please
(Please) Please
(Please) Please
(Please) Please
Baby please come home
(Christmas)
Baby please come home
(Christmas)
Baby please come home
(Christmas)
(Christmas)
(Christmas)


Silent night
Holy night
All is calm
All is bright
'Round yon virgin
Mother and Child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night
Holy night
Son of God
Oh love's pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus, Jesus, Lord at thy birth
Oh, Jesus, Lord at thy birth

Sleep, sleep
Sleep in heavenly, heavenly peace
Sleep, sleep, sleep in heavenly,
heavenly, heavenly peace
Peace, peace
Sleep, sleep,
sleep in heavenly peace


O holy night the stars are
brightly shining
It is the night of our dear
Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin
and error pining
Till He appeared
and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope
the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks
a new glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angels' voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine, O night O night divine
A thrill of hope
the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks
a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angels' voices
O night divine O night
when Christ was born
O night divine, O night O night divine


The fire is burning
The room`s all aglow
Outside the December wind blows
Away in the distance the carolers
sing in the snow
Everybody`s laughing
The world is celebrating
And everyone`s so happy
Except for me tonight
Because I miss you
Most at Christmas time
And I can`t get you
Get you off my mind
Every other season comes along
And I`m all right
But then I miss you
most at Christmas time

I gaze out the window
This cold winter`s night
At all of the twinkling lights
Alone in the darkness
Remembering when you were mine
Everybody`s smiling
The whole world is rejoicing
And everyone`s embracing
Except for you and I
Baby I miss you
Most at Christmas time
And I can`t get you
Get you off my mind
Every other season comes along
And I`m all right
But then I miss you
most at Christmas time
In the springtime
those memories start to fade
With the April rain
Through the summer days
Till autumn`s leaves are gone
I get by without you
Till the snow begins to fall
And then I miss you
Most at Christmas time
And I can`t get you
Get you off my mind
Every other season comes along
And I`m all right...
But then I miss you
most at Christmas time

One dark night
Something said, ＂Follow the light＂
So you look up and see the word
That's written upon the sky
Strong and wise
Keeping the Lord as your guide
And through the doubt, you realize
He's with you all the while

Follow that star above you
Should the world try to break you down
There is one who waits for you
Though you can't see him now
Thunder and rain surrounds you
But His love's just a breath away
If you follow your heart, follow the light
Follow that... star

Follow your heart, it's Christmas
Follow your heart, it's Christmas

Shining bright
The spirit of love at first sight
And when the door won't welcome you
Heaven will help you inside
Gathered 'round
Bearing the gifts to the crown
A miracle comes, the babe is born
And angels are heard on high

Follow that star above you
Should the world try to break you down
There is one who waits for you
Though you can't see him now
Thunder and rain surrounds you
But His love's just a breath away
If you follow your heart, follow the light
Follow that... star

Follow your heart, it's Christmas
Follow your heart, it's Christmas

Follow that voice you heard
that no one else believed
Follow the dream that brought the King
on Christmas Eve, oh

Follow that star above you
Should the world try to break you down
There is one who waits for you
Though you can't see him now
Thunder and rain surrounds you
But His love's just a breath away
If you follow the voice, follow the song
Follow the word that makes you strong
Follow your heart, follow the light
Follow that... star

Follow your heart, it's Christmas
Follow your heart, it's Christmas
Follow your heart, it's Christmas
Follow your heart, it's Christmas
Follow your heart, it's Christmas
Follow your heart, it's Christmas
Follow your heart, it's Christmas

And I don't know how
You do the things you do
while I sleep on Christmas eve
But it's amazing
And I bet that you could
bring me back my baby
Because every time
I see Christmas lights
I feel this burn inside
And I just can't take it

I saw them shopping last week
And his new girl was so bleak
And then I swore to myself
Santa's gonna come and make
him mine this Christmas night

Ho, ho, ho
Santa's gonna come

Santa's gonna come
and make you mine, ho, ho, ho
Santa's gonna come

Oh Santa
I heard that it's really
gonna snow this year
So I hope Rudolph and
them other eight reindeer
Get you safely here
So you can scoop him up and
swoop him right down my chimney
I've been really, really,
really good this year
So put on that red suit
and make him appear
'Cause Christmas cheer
Just ain't the same without my baby
Come on, oh Kris Kringle,
send me help

They say it's unrealistic
But I believe in you Saint Nick
So grant this wish for me right quick
Santa won't you come and make
him mine this Christmas night?

Ho, ho, ho
Santa's gonna come and
make you mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and
make you mine, ho, ho, ho
Santa's gonna come
and make you mine this Christmas night

Oh, Santa
Oh, Santa
Oh, Santa
Come on, Santa

Oh Santa
Santa gon' come
and make him mine this Christmas
Santa gon' come
and make him mine, mine
Oh Santa
Santa gon' come
and make him mine this Christmas
Santa gon' come
and make him mine, mine

Oh, Santa Claus
If you get this letter,
please don't make me wait
‘Cause all December
I'll be counting down the days
So hop on your sleigh
I promise that I won't forget
the milk and cookies

The trees all sparkly and gold
But inside I feel so cold
So soon as you leave the North Pole
Santa won't you come
and make him mine this Christmas?

Santa's gonna come
and make you mine, ho, ho, ho
Santa's gonna come
and make you mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come
and make you mine, ho, ho, ho
Santa's gonna come
and make you mine, mine

Santa's gonna come
and make you mine, mine
Santa gon' come
and make you mine this Christmas

You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

I feel good
I feel nice
I've never felt so
Satisfied
I'm in love
I'm alive
Intoxicated
Flying high
It feels like a dream
When you touch me tenderly
I don't know if it's real
But I like the way I feel
Inside

You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

In the morning
When I rise
You are the first thing
On my mind
And in the middle
Of the night
I feel your heartbeat
Next to mine
If feels like a dream
When you love me tenderly
I don't know if you're for real
But I like the way I feel
Inside

You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

You know the way to
make me lose control
When you're looking
into my eyes
You make me feel so
High

You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above


There's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

It's a long road
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand
For you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself
And the emptiness you felt
Will disappear

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

Lord knows
Dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone
Tear them away
Hold on
There will be tomorrow
In time
You'll find the way

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you


My love
theres only you in my life
the only thing thats right
My first love

Youre every step I make
And I I want to share

And I'll give it all to you

Honey, You can have me when you want me
If you just simply ask me to be there
And youre the only one who makes me come running
Cause what you got is far beyond compare

And its just like honey
When your love comes over me
Oh baby, Ive got a dependancy
Always strung out for another taste of your honey

Its like honey really washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And Im dyin for ya, cryin for ya, I adore ya
One hit of your love addicted me
Now Im strung out on you darlin
Dont you see every night and day
I cant hardly wait for another taste of honey

Honey I cant describe
How good it feels inside
Honey I cant describe
How good it feels inside

I cant be elusive with you Honey
Cause Its blatant that Ive feeling you
And its too hard for me to leave abruptly
Cause youre the only thing I wanna do

And its just like Honey
When your love comes over me
Oh baby, Ive got a dependancy
Always strung out for another
Taste of your honey

Its like honey really washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And Im dyin for ya, cryin for ya, I adore ya
One hit of your love addicted me
Now Im strung out on you darlin
Dont you see every night and day
I cant hardly wait for another taste of honey

Honey I cant describe
How good it feels inside
Honey I cant describe
How good it feels inside


How can I just let you walk away
Just let you leave without a trace
When I stand here
Taking every breath with you
Youre the only one
Who really knew me at all

How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave
Cause we shared
The laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears
Youre the only one
Who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
Theres just an empty space
Theres nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face

Take a good look at me now
Theres just an empty space
And you coming back to me
Is against all the odds
And thats what I got to take

I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
Theres so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why
Youre the only one
Who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
Theres just an empty space
Theres nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face

Take a good look at me now
Theres just an empty space
But to wait for you is all I can do
And thats what Ive got to face

Take a good look at me now
Cause Ill still be standing there
And you coming back to me
Is against all the odds
And thats what I got to take

Take a good look at me now


Why you mad? Talkin'
'bout you're mad
Could it be that you
just lost the best
you've ever had?
That’s your bag,
yup, that’s too bad
Show is over,
you ain’t gotta act
Name hold weight
like kilos
Boy, you actin'
so corny like Fritos
Wouldn’t have none
of that without me though
Ain’t none of my business,
it's tea though
Outta ammo, gotta reload
If life was a game,
you're a free throw
It's nothing that you
don’t already know

Close the door, lose the key
Leave my heart on the mat for me
I was yours eternally
There’s an end to infinity
To infinity

How I say this? Fact
that you still exist
No disrespect,
no second thought
it truly, truly is
Truthfully I’m through with this
Why are we still doing this?
Answer the phone
like, "Who is this?"
Take your head and
knock some sense
Je ne comprends pas
Ain’t no compliments (duh)
Ain’t no being friends (duh)
Ain’t no false pretense (duh)
Ain’t no make amends (duh)
Ain’t no come agains (duh)
That’s the story,
ain’t no happy ends

Close the door, lose the key
Leave my heart on the mat for me
I was yours eternally
There’s an end to infinity
To infinity

Is it lack of
ice got you so cold?
Have you ever felt
this on your own?
Why you tryin' to play
like you’re so grown?
Everything you own,
boy, you still owe

Close the door, lose the key
Leave my heart on the mat for me
I was yours eternally
There’s an end to infinity
To infinity

You're leaving,
you're leaving, you're out the door
Infinity loving
me more and more
You're leaving,
you're leaving,
you're out the door
Infinity loving
me more and more
Cause I believe infinity
is more than just a made up dream
I believe infinity is
more than just a made up dream


One summer night
We ran away for a while
Laughing, we hurried beneath the sky
To an obscure place to hide
That no-one could find

And we drifted to another state of mind
And imagined I was yours and you were mine
As we lay upon the grass
There in the dark
Underneath the stars
(Young love)
Underneath the stars

Weak in the knees
Wrapped in the warm gentle breeze
So shy, a bundle of butterflies
Flush with heat of desire
On a natural high

As we drifted to another place in time
And the feeling was so heady and sublime
As I lost my heart to you
There in the dark
Underneath the stars
(Young love)

Beautiful and bittersweetly
You were fading into me
And I was gently fading into you
But the time went sailing by
Reluctantly we said goodbye
And left our secret place so far behind
And I lay in bed all night
And I was drifting
Drifting
Drifting
Drifting

And I was yours
And you were my own
My own baby
As we lay
As we
Lay underneath the stars
(Young love)


Lying beside you here in the dark
Feeling your heart beat with mine
Softly you whisper
You're so sincere
How could our love be so blind

We sailed on together
We drifted apart
And here you are by my side

So now I come to you with open arms
Nothing to hide
Believe what I say
So here I am with open arms
Hoping you'll see what your love means to me
Open arms

Living without you
Living alone
This empty house seems so cold
Wanting to hold you
Wanting you near
How much I wanted you home

But now that you've come back
Turned night into day
I need you to stay

So now I come to you with open arms
Nothing to hide
Believe what I say
So here I am with open arms
Hoping you'll see what your love means to me
Open arms
Arms Arms


Soft heavenly eyes gazed into me
Transcending space and time
And I was rendered still
There were no words for me to find at all
As I stood there beside myself
I could see you and no-one else

When I saw you
When I saw you
I could not breathe
I fell so deep
When I saw you
When I saw you
I'd never be
I'd never be the same

Only once in a lifetime love rushes in
Changing you with the tide
And dawn's ribbon of light
Bursts through the dark
Wakening you inside
And I thought it was all untrue
Until there, all at once, I knew

When I saw you
When I saw you
I could not breathe
I fell so deep
When I saw you
When I saw you
I'd never be
I'd never be the same

With no beginning
And without an end
You are the one for me
And it's evident
And your eyes told me so
Your eyes let me know

When I saw you
When I saw you
I could not breathe
I fell so deep
When I saw you
When I saw you
I'd never be
I'd never be the same


Once upon a time
You whispered softly in my ear
Loving words and fairytales
That I longed to hear
I gave you my body and soul
And you took control
As you slowly swept me up
And carried me away
You told me pretty lies
As I held onto you tight
You knew how to get your way
Ignorance was bliss in your warm embrace

Long ago
You used to want me
Now its all so far away
But you still haunt me
And take me back to yesterday

Every now and then
I drown in thoughts of yesterday
And the fools paradise that you blew away
I feel you beside me again
And remember when you came to my window
On a dark and stormy day
Baby, I need you now
Tonight Im crumbling down
Sinking in the memories
Shadows of you keep washing over me

Long ago
You used to want me
Now its all so far away
But you still haunt me

Long ago
You used to want me
Now its all so far away
But you still haunt me
And take me back to yesterday

(So long ago)
(So long ago)
(So long ago)
(So long ago)
(So long ago)
(So long ago)
(So long ago)
(So long ago)

Baby, I need you now
Cause tonight Im crumbling down
Sinking in the memories
Shadows of you keep washing over me

Long ago
You used to want me
Now its all so far away
But you still haunt me
And take me back to yesterday

Long ago
You used to want me
Now its all so far away
But you still haunt me

Long ago
You used to want me
Now its all so far away
But you still haunt me


You come to me with a casual flow
And suddenly, my defences start to go
When you talk to me in that sensual tone
It envelops me and I lose my self control

And baby, I just melt away
Fall like rain
Everytime I see your face, I go off
I just want to break it down
Anytime you come around
Maybe I could melt away in your arms

Imagining that your taking it slow
And so tenderly
Till the feeling overflows
When you look at me I go soft and cave in
And I cant conceal that Im slowly weakening

And baby, I just melt away
Fall like rain
Everytime I see your face, I go off
I just want to break it down
Anytime you come around
Maybe I could melt away in your arms

You and me in a cloud of reverie
Spin around inside my head unendingly
Thoughts run wild as I sit and rhapsodize
Pretty pictures of what Id do if you were mine

And baby, I just melt away
Fall like rain
Everytime I see your face, I go off
I just want to break it down
Anytime you come around
Maybe I could melt away in your arms

And baby, I just melt away
Fall like rain
Everytime I see your face, I go off
I just want to break it down
Anytime you come around
Maybe I could melt away in your arms

I had it all
But I let it slip away
Couldn't see that I treated you wrong
Now I wander around
Feeling down and cold
Trying to believe that you're gone

Chorus:
Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain
Inside 'cause
Love takes time
I don't wanna be here alone

Losing my mind
From this hollow in my heart
Suddenly I'm so incomplete
Lord I'm needing you now
Tell me how to stop the rain
Tears are falling down endlessly

Chorus

You might say that it's over
You might say that you don't care
You might say you don't miss me
You don't need me
But I know that you do and I feel that you do
Inside

Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain
Inside 'cause
Love takes time
I don't wanna be there
I don't wanna be there alone

You were so blind to let me go
You had it all but didn't know
No one you'll ever find will be
Closer to all your dreams than me
Believing the grass would be greener
You told yourself "I just don't need her now"
But I know you'll soon discover
You're never satisfied with any other

Chorus:
Someday Oo Someday
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score

You'll change your mind and call my name
Soon as you find they're all the same
And when you find yourself alone
Don't come back crying
You should have known
Believe me I'm not pretending
It's not hard to predict
This ending now
'Cause I know you'll soon discover
You're needing me in spite of all the others

Chorus

Maybe now you just can't conceive
That there'll ever come a time when you're cold and lonely
Baby, how could you ever believe
That another could replace me
The one and only
But when your down
In your time of need
And you're thinking that you
Might be coming back to own me
Just think again 'cause
I won't need your love anymore!

Once again we sit in silence
After all is said and done
Only emptiness inside us
Baby, look what we've become
We can make a million promises
But we still won't change
It isn't right to stay together
When you only bring each other pain

Chorus:
I don't wanna cry
Don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world
Could take us back
To where we used to be
Though I've give you my heart and soul
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry

Too far apart to bridge the distance
But something keeps us hanging on and on
Pretending not to know the difference
Denying what we had is gone
Every moment we're together
It's just breaking me down
I know we swore it was forever
But it hurts too much to stay around

Chorus

All the magic's gone
There's just a shadow of a memory
Something just went wrong
We can't go on make-believing

There you are, holding her hand
I am lost, dying to understand
Didn't I cherish you right
Don't you know you were my life

Even though I try,
I can't let go
Something in your eyes
captured my soul
And every night I see
you in my dreams
You're all I know,
I can't let go

Just cast aside,
you don't even know I'm alive
You just walk on by,
don't care to see me cry
And here I am,
still holding on
I can't accept
my world is gone, no, no

Even though I try,
I can't let go
'Cause something in your eyes
captured my soul
And every night I see
you in my dreams
You're all I know,
I can't let go

Do you even realize
the sorrow I have inside
Every day of my life
Do you know the way it feels
when all you have just dies
I try and try
to deny that I need you
But still you remain
on my mind

No I just can't get you
out of my mind
I never can say goodbye
'Cause every night I see
you in my dreams

You're all I know,
I can't let you go
Even though I try
I can't let go
Something about you
that I need
that I need so badly
You're all I know,
I can't let go

Not more than three short years ago
I was abandoned and alone
Without a penny to my name
So very young and so afraid
No proper shoes upon my feet
Sometimes I couldn't even eat
I often cried myself to sleep

But still I had to keep on going
Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith
I struggled and I prayed
And now I've found my way

Chorus:
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
(Make it happen)
And if you get down on your
knees at night
And pray to the lord
He's gonna make it happen
(Make it happen)

I know life can be so tough
And you feel like giving up
But you must be strong
Baby just hold on
You'll never find the answers
if you throw your life away
I used to feel the way you do

Still I have to keep going
Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith
I struggled and I prayed
And now I've finally found my way

Chorus

I once was lost
But now I'm found
I got my feet on solid ground
Thank you Lord
If you believe within your soul
Just hold on tight
And don't let go
You can make it happen
(Make it happen)

Many nights we pray with
no proof anyone could hear
In our hearts a hopeful
song we barely understood
Now we are not afraid although
we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains long
before we know we could,
oh yes

There can be miracles,
when you believe
Though hope is frail
it's hard to kill
Who knows what
miracles you can achieve
When you believe,
somehow you will
You will when you believe

In this time of fear when
prayer so often
proves in vain
Hope seems like the summer
birds too swiftly flown away
And now I am standing here,
my heart's so full
I can't explain
Seeking faith and
speaking words
I never thought I'd say

There can be miracles,
when you believe
Though hope is frail,
it's hard to kill
Who knows what
miracles you can achieve
When you believe,
somehow you will
You will when you believe

They don't always
happen when you ask
And it's easy to
give in to your fear
But when you're
blinded by your pain
Can't see the way safe
through the rain
Thought of a still
resilient voice says
love is very near

There can be miracles,
when you believe
Though hope is frail,
it's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
you can achieve
When you believe,
somehow you will, now you will
You will when you believe

You will when you believe
Just believe
You will
Just believe
You will when you
Believe

You look in my eyes and I get emotional inside.
I know it's crazy but you still can touch my heart.
And after all this time you'd think that I,
I wouldn't feel the same but time melts into nothing and nothing's changed.

CHORUS:
I still believe someday you and me will find ourselves in love again.
I had a dream someday you and me will find ourselves in love again.

Each day of my life I'm filled with all the joy I could find.
You know that I, I'm not the desperate type.
If there's one spark of hope left in my grasp, I'll hold it with both hands.
It's worth the risk of burning to have a second chance.
No, no no no no no I need you baby.
I still believe that we can be together (haaoo).
If we believe that true love never has to end.
Then we must know that we will love again.

CHORUS:
I still believe (yeeaaah) someday you and me will find ourselves in
love again. Oh baby yeah, I had a dream someday you and me will find
ourselves in love again. I still believe (oh baby I do) some day you
and me (just give me one more try) in love again.
I had a dream (I miss your love) someday you and me will find ourselves in love again.
I still believe (yeah I still believe) someday you and me (baby) in love again.

[Jay-Z:]
Yeah
Aight
([MC:] We're gonna do it like this)
Let's go
Jigga

[MC:]
(Gimme your love, gimme your love)
(Gimme your love, gimme your love)

[Jay-Z:]
Aight
You gotta bounce to this like this
You almost kinda watching this
Aha, whooo
Escape

[MC:]
Boy your love's so good
I don't wanna let go
And although I should
I can't leave you alone
Cause you're so disarming
I'm caught up in the midst of you
And I cannot resist at all
Boy if I do
The things you wanna to
The way I used to do
Could you love me baby
You leave me feelin used
Cause you go and break my heart

Heartbreaker you've got the best of me
But I just keep on comin' back incessantly
Oh why did you have to run your game on me
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart
(Gimme your love, gimme your love)
(Gimme your love, gimme your love)

It's a shame to be
So euphoric and weak
When you smile at me
And you tell me things
That you know persuade me
To relinquish my love to you
But I cannot resist
At all
Boy if I do
The things you wanna to
The way I used to do
Would you love me baby
You leave me feelin used
Cause you go and break my heart

Heartbreaker you've got the best of me
But I just keep on comin' back incessantly
Oh why did you have to run your game on me
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart

[Jay-Z:]
She wanna shop with Jay
Play box with Jay
She wanna pillowfight in the middle
What a night
She wanna drive my benz
With 5 of her friends
She wanna creep past the block
Spyin' again
She wanna roll with Jay
Chase skeeos away
She wanna fight with lame chicks
Blow my day
She wanna expect the rest
Kick me to the curb
If she find one strand of hair
Longer than hers
She want love in the Jacuzzi
Rub up in the movies
Access to the old crib
Keys to the newbie
She wanna answer the phone
Tattoo her arm
That's when I gotta send her back to
Her mom
She called me heartbreaker
When we apart it makes her
Wanna piece of paper
Scribble down "I hate ya"
When she know she love Jay because
She love everything Jay say, Jay does
And uhh

[MC:]
Heartbreaker you've got the best of me
But I just keep on comin' back incessantly
Oh why did you have to run your game on me
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart

(Gimme your love, gimme your love)
(Gimme your love, gimme your love)

Heartbreaker you've got the best of me
But I just keep on comin' back incessantly
Oh why did you have to run your game on me
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart

(Gimme your love, gimme your love)
(Gimme your love, gimme your love)

Heartbreaker you've got the best of me
But I just keep on comin' back incessantly
Oh why did you have to run your game on me
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart

(Gimme your love, gimme your love)
(Gimme your love, gimme your love)

I would give up everything
Before I'd separate myself from you
After so much suffering
I finally found unvarnished truth
I was all by myself for the longest time
So cold inside
And the hurt from the heart it would not subside
I felt like dying
Until you saved my life

(Chorus - all)
Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
Cause baby I'm so thankful
I found you

(Joe)
I would give you everything
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
To ensure your happiness
I'll cherish every part of you
Because without you beside me I can't survive
I don't wanna try
If you're keeping me warm each and every night
I'll be all right
Cause I need you in my life

(Chorus - all)
Thank God I found you (I'm begging you)
I was lost without you (so lost without you)
My every wish and every dream (every dream, every dream)
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight (brought the sunlight)
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
Cause baby I'm so thankful
I found you


-Bridge- (Mariah & Joe)
See I was so desolate
Before you came to me
Looking back I guess it shows
that we were destined to shine
After the rain to appreciate
And care for what we have
And I'd go through it all over again
To be able to feel this way

(Chorus - all)
Thank God I found you
I was lost without you (lost without you baby)
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life (whole life)
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
Sweet baby I'm so thankful
I found you


(Chorus - all)
Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
My baby I'm so thankful
I found you

(Mariah)
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
My baby I'm so thankful I found you

[Verse 1]
ohh...sweet love yeah [yeah]
I didn't mean it when I said
I didn't love you so
I should have held on tight
I never should have let you go
I didn't know nothing,
I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lying to myself
I couldn't have fathomed
I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sitting
Here beside myself
Guess I didn't know you
Guess I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything
I never felt

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The feeling that I'm feeling
Now that I don’t hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips
Cause I don't have a choice
Oh what I wouldn't give
To have you lying by my side
Right here cause baby

[Chorus 1]
When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby please cause
We belong together
Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone
Till the sun comes up
Who's gonna take your place
There ain't nobody better
Oh baby baby
We belong together

[Verse 2]
I can't sleep at night
When you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Singing to me ＂If You Think You're Lonely Now＂
Wait a minute this is too deep [too deep]
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial tryin' to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
＂I Only Think Of You＂ and it's breakin' my heart
I'm tryin' to keep it together but I'm falling apart

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm feeling all out of my element
Throwing things, crying tryin'
To figure out where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you, need you back in my life baby

[Chorus 2]
When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby please cause
We belong together
Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone
Till the sun comes up
Who's gonna take your place
There ain't nobody better
Oh baby baby
We belong together baby

[Outro]
When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby please cause
We belong together
Who am I gonna lean on when times get rough
Who's gonna talk to me till the sun comes up
Who's gonna take your place
There ain't nobody better
Oh baby baby
We belong together

I gotta shake you off
Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay
I gotta shake, shake you off
Just like the Calgon commercial
I really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere
I gotta shake you off
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates all the love I give
I gotta shake, shake you off
Gotta do what's best for me
Baby and that means I gotta
Shake you off

By the time you get this message
It's gonna be too late
So don't bother paging me
Cause I'll be on my way
See I grabbed all my diamonds and clothes
Just ask your momma she knows
You're gonna miss me baby
Hate to say I told you so
Well at first I didn't know
But now it's clear to me
You would cheat with all your freaks
And lie compulsively
So I packed up my Louis Vuitton
Jumped in your ride and took off
You'll never ever find a girl
Who loves you more than me

I gotta shake you off
Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay
I gotta shake, shake you off
Just like the Calgon commercial
I really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere
I gotta shake you off
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates all the love I give
I gotta shake, shake you off
Gotta do what's best for me
Baby and that means I gotta
Shake you off

I gotta shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it off ...

I found out about a gang
Of your dirty little deeds
With this one and that one
By the pool, on the beach, in the streets
Heard y'all was
Hold up my phone's breakin' up
I'ma hang up and call the machine right back
I gotta get this off of my mind
You wasn't worth my time
So I'm leaving you behind
Cause I need a real love in my life
Save this recording because
I'm never coming back home
Baby I'm gone
Don't cha know

I gotta shake you off
Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay
I gotta shake, shake you off
Just like the Calgon commercial
I really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere
I gotta shake you off
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates all the love I give
I gotta shake, shake you off
Gotta do what's best for me
Baby and that means I gotta
Shake you off

I gotta shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it off ...

Ever since you left me
I've been trying to hide the pain
Painting on a smile with lipstick
Putting on a big charade
So difficult to keep pretending
It's getting harder everyday
It's plain to see, I'm cold and heartsick
Since you turned and walked away
I just keep going round and round
And round in circles
Keep on tumbling down

[chorus]
Oh boy, my world has changed
And I don't think I can make it without you
Nothing's the same
You got me running around in circles over you
(Running around in circles over you)

Saturday I saw you
Holding hands with someone new
Somehow I kept my composure
Just like everything was cool
But inside I kept repeating
Don't you let them see you cry
So I casually turned my head
As the tears rolled down my eyes
I just keep going round and round
And round in circles
Keep on tumbling down

[chorus]
Oh boy, my world has changed
And I don't think I can make it without you
Nothing's the same
You got me running around in circles over you

Everything is you
How can I pull through
My heart is consumed, I'm so confused
Still caught up in you, love can be so cruel
Baby, don't know how to turn you loose

[chorus]
Oh boy, my world has changed
And I don't think I can make it without you
No, nothing's the same
You got me running around
And running around
And running around
Nothing's the same
Baby, baby cause you
Got me running around
In circles over you
(Running around in circles over you)

[Verse 1]
I ain't even mad, no, not like befo'
Off with your head,
now slither out the door
Snakes in the grass,
it's time to cut the lawn
Ed Scissorhands,
AKA ＂I Cut You Off＂
(No) You ain't gonna lie to my face no mo'
Hit me with 'I'm sorry', but I'm sorry, no
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, no
Get me Ed Shapiro on the phone
(Case closed)

[Pre-Chorus]
You shoulda known that
it's bigger than you
You'll never know what I already knew
After everything I already been through
I can't waste no time,
pay no 'tention to you

[Chorus]
I said no
No no no
A no no
No no
That's a no no
No no
I said no no
No no

[Verse 2]
You came so close, you just don't know
Irregardless of what transpired
It ain't even worthy of a slick reply
Even if I was the last woman alive
I would be like Ginger,
you ain't Gilligan isle
Really don't care,
I'm in love with the island
Rockin' Dior 'cause it goes
 with my diamonds
Got a pink gown Custom by Alaia
I'll be on stage with the stadium light up

[Pre-Chorus]
You shoulda' known that
it's bigger than you
You'll never know what I already knew
After everything I already been through
I can't waste no time,
pay no 'tention to you

[Chorus]
I said no
No no no
A no no
No no
That's a no no
No no
I said no no
No no
I said no
(I said no)
A no no
No no
That's a no no
No no, I said no no
No no
No

Japanese? Boy, you know
(I said no)

I said no

I think, I think that was it
Yep

I look at you looking at me
Feels like a feeling meant to be
And as your body moves with mine
It's iike I'm lifted out of time

And time again
Patientiy I've waited
For this moment to arrive

CHORUS 1:
After tonight
Will you remember
How sweet and tenderly
You reached for me
And pulled me closer
After you go
Will you return to love me
After tonight begins to fade

I feel your touch caressing me
This feeling's all l'll ever need
With every kiss from your sweet lips
lt's like I'm drifting out of time

Alone will tell
If you feel the way I feel
When I look in your eyes

CHORUS 2:
After tonight
Will you remember
How sweet and tenderly
You reached for me
And pulled-me closer
After you go
Will you return to love me
After the night becomes the day

Time
And time and time again
So patiently I've waited
For this moment to arrive

CHORUS 3:
After tonight
Will you remember
How sweet and tenderly
You reached for me
And pulled me closer
After you go
Baby will you return to love me
After the night becomes the day
After tonight begins to fade

Ah, ah, you’re beautiful
Yeah
Ah, ah, you’re beautiful
Hop on the back of my bike
Let the good wind blow through your hair
With an ass like that and a smile so bright
Oh, you’re killing me, you know it ain’t fair, yeah
Ride on through the middle of the night
Let the moonlight kiss your skin
When you dance like that, your jeans so tight
Oh, you’re killing me, baby do it again
You’re beautiful, and your mind is fucking beautiful
And I can’t pretend that doesn’t mean a thing to me, to me, yeah
You’re beautiful, good lord, you’re fucking beautiful
And I can’t pretend that doesn’t mean a thing to me, to me, yeah, yeah
I like when you run red lights
Don’t stop ’til you thrill me, oh how you thrill me
Always in control, how you do it, I don’t know
But I don’t care, take me anywhere
‘Cause it’s beautiful, ooh you make me feel invincible
And I can’t pretend that doesn’t mean a thing to me, to me, oh yeah
You’re beautiful, and your mind is fucking beautiful
And I can’t pretend that doesn’t mean a thing to me, to me, yeah
You’re beautiful, good lord, you’re fucking beautiful
And I can’t pretend that doesn’t mean a thing to me, to me, yeah, yeah
Ohh oo ohh, ohh oo ohh ah, ah, so beautiful
Yeah Yeah ah, ah, so beautiful

Don’t you worry darling oh oh ah, oh oh ah, oh oh ah, ah ah ah

I'm not your world
No, I'm not your life
Tell me what that means to you
If it was me that was by your side
Limitless, without no rules
Nothin' to lose
Never no pressure
Just put yourself into my shoes
I'm not your world
No, I'm not your life

[Verse 1: Mariah Carey]
That cigarette, put it out, put it out
Keep lookin' my way
turn around, turn around
This is a moment you can't buy
I see that longing in your eyes

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Somethin' is tellin' me you're ready
am I wrong?
Maybe the lyrics are too heavy in my song
How would you feel if you had me
then I was gone?
Better not be leadin' me on

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
I'm not your world
No, I'm not your life
Tell me what that means to you
If it was me that was by your side
Limitless, without no rules
Nothin' to lose
Never no pressure
Just put yourself into my shoes
I'm not your world
No, I'm not your life

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey]
I'm a confirmation, should you feel unsure
I'm that security when you're insecure
I'll be that baby girl when you're immature
Don't be ambivalent towards me

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Somethin' is tellin' me you're ready
am I wrong?
Maybe the lyrics are too heavy in my song
How would you feel if you had me
then I was gone?
Better not be leadin' me on

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
I'm not your world
No, I'm not your life
Tell me what that means to you
If it was me that was by your side
Limitless, without no rules
Nothin' to lose (Nothing)
Never no pressure (Never)
Just put yourself into my shoes
(Into my shoes)
I'm not your world
No, I'm not your life
(I'm not your life, oh baby I'm)
I'm not your world
No, I'm not your life
(Baby, I wanna be your life)
Tell me what that means to you
If it was me that was by your side
Limitless, without no rules (Limitless)
Nothin' to lose (Nothing to lose)
Never no pressure (No pressure)
Just put yourself into my shoes
I'm not your world
No, I'm not your life, baby
Ahh

[Outro: Mariah Carey & Timbaland]
Break it down
(I'm not your world
No, I'm not your life
Tell me what that means to you)
Said, I'm not your world
(By your side
Limitless, without no rules
Nothin' to lose)
Nothin' to lose, no pressure
Uh (Limitless, without no rules
Nothin' to lose)
Nothing (C'mon, MC)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (C'mon)
Nothin' to lose, no pressure (Break it)
No pressure (Break it)
Ooh (C'mon, MC)
Ah, ah, ah, ah (Uh, c'mon)
La-da-da-da-da-da
I'm not your life (What you say, girl?)
Limitless, without no rules (Break it)
Your life (C'mon, what you say, girl?
What you say, girl?
What you say, girl?
C'mon)

Shattered dreams
Cut through my mind
Tragically our love has died
Memories confine my head
Bitterly I face the end
Trustingly
I gave my self to you
I let you inside
Believing your lies

Chorus:
And you don't remember
Every time you told me
You were mine for ever
For eternity
And you don't remember
How you used to hold me
How we'd melt together
How you needed me
How we used to be
In love

Stranded here
In notingness
With only tears
And lonliness
Foolishly
I gave my soul to you
I let you inside
Believing your lies
Chorus
Helplessly
I fell so deep
I was so naive
To let you in
Why did I let you in
To my heart

And you don't remember
Anything you told me
You were mine forever
For eternity
I know you don't remember
How you used to hold me
How we'd melt together
Together
How you needed me
How we used to be
In love

If you only knew
What I feel for you
If you only lived for me
And I lived for you
I'd be in heaven
My dreams would come true

'Cause all I've ever wanted
Is you
And you alone
And I love you so
More than you could ever know
All I've ever wanted
Is you

If you were my own
To caress and hold
I would shower you with love
And drown within your soul
Because I live and breathe for you
And I really need to know

That all I've ever wanted
Is you
And you alone
And I love you so
More than you could ever know
All I've ever wanted
Is you

Everything I do is for you
You are every part of me
And I don't want to face
Another day
Alone
Without your love

'Cause all I've ever wanted
Is you
And you alone
And I love you so
More than you could ever know
All I've ever wanted
Is you
All I've ever wanted
Is you

Come closer
You seem so far away
There's something I know you need to say
I feel your emotions
When I look in your eyes
Your silence
Whispering misunderstandings
There's so much you need to realize
You'll feel my emotions if you look in my eyes

Chorus:
Hey darlin'
I know you think my love is slipping away
But baby it's all in your mind
Don't worry
Hold on tight and hear me when I say
Baby it's all in your mind

Believe me I believe in you
There's nothing this feeling couldn't do
Move closer my darling
Feel the love in my eyes

Hey, hey.....
You're almost home
You're almost home
You're almost home

I've seen the light in the sky
In the skies are like fireflies
Burning bright, just to vanish in the dark

I've held hope in my two hands
That there would be another chance
To find the kingdom, I'm believing in my heart
Cause underneath the good there's something greater than you know

When you're almost there
And you're almost home
Just open up your eyes and go, go
When you're almost there, almost home
Know you're not alone
You're almost home

When you run, run so far
You've forgotten who you are
Where you're from, it's like some other universe
You count your steps, like they're regrets
You catch one breath then lose the rest
Wrong is right, right is left
And there's nowhere left to turn

So don't believe in everything
You think, you think you know

When you're almost there
And you're almost home
Just open up your eyes and go, go
When you're almost there, almost home
Know you're not alone
You're almost home

When you let your heart be the compass
You won't get lost, not if you trust it
When you hear the sound of the trumpet
Louder than ever before

Oh, when you're almost there
Almost home
Just open up your eyes and go, go
Cause you're almost there
Almost home
Know you're not alone
You're almost home

When you're almost there
Almost home
Just open up your eyes and go, go
Almost there
You're almost home
Know you're not alone
You're almost home
Swept me away
But now I'm lost in the dark
Set me on fire
But now I'm left with a spark
Alone, you got beyond the haze and
I'm lost inside the maze
I guess I'm all alone in love

I look into your eyes
You turn the other way
And now I realize
It's all a game you play
I hold you in the night
And wake to find you gone
You're running out of sight
It's so hard holding on
All alone in love

Chorus

You haunt me in your dreams
I'm calling out your name
I watch you fade away
Your love is not the same
I've figured out your style
To quickly drift apart
You held me for a while
Planned it from the start
All alone in love

Sitting in the dark without you
How am I supposed to make it
Through the night
Slowly fall apart without you
Cry away the hours
Till the morning light

Yea, yea I'm out that Brooklyn
now I'm down in Tribeca
Right next to DeNiro, but
I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra, and
since I made it here
I can make it anywhere
yea, they love me everywhere
I used to cop in Harlem,
All of my Dominicano's
right there up on Broadway,
Pull me back to that
McDonald's, took it
to my stashbox
560 State St.
Catch me in the kitchen
like a Simmons wippin' pastry's
Cruisin' down 8th St.
off white Lexus
Drivin' so slow, but BK
is from Texas
Me, I'm out that Bed-Stuy
home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on Billboard
and I brought my boys with me
Say whattup to Ty-Ty
still sippin' Mai Tai's
Sittin' courtside, Knicks
and Nets give me high five
Nigga I be Spike'd out
I could trip a referee
Tell by my attitude that
I'm most definitely from1

But I got a gang of niggas

Welcome to the melting pot
corners where we sellin' rock
Afrika Bambataa shit
home of the hip-hop
Yellow cab, gypsy cab
dollar cab, holla back
For foreigners it ain't for

how to act
Eight million stories
out there in it naked
City is a pity, half of

Lights is blinding
girls need blinders
So they can step out of
bounds quick, the sidelines

Lined with casualties
who sip to life casually
Then gradually become worse
don't bite the apple, Eve
Caught up in the in-crowd
now you're in style
End of the winter gets cold
en vogue, with your skin out
City of sin, it's a pity
on the whim
Good girls gone bad
the city's filled with them
Mommy took a bus trip
now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just
like a bus route
Hail Mary to the city
you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you
life starts when the church end
Came here for school
graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars
addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feelin'
like a champion
The city never sleeps
better slip you an Ambien

Back to running circles ’round niggas, now we squared up

But I know that if I stay stunting
All these girls only gon’ want one thing

The most incredible baby
I can't see 'em
comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see 'em
comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
Good dudes
I know you love me
like cooked food
Even though you know got
move like a crook move
We was together
on the block since we lunch
We shoulda been together
havin 4 Seasons brunch
We used to use umbrellas
to face the bad weather
So now we travel first class
to change the forecast
Never in bunches
just me and you
I loved your point of view
cause you held no punches
Still I left you
for months on end
It's been months since
I checked back in
Well somewhere in a small town
lockin a mall down
Woodgrain four and change
Armor All'd down
I can understand
why you want a divorce now
Though I can't let you know it
pride won't let me show it
Pretend to be heroic
that's just one to grow with
But deep inside a nigga so sick
I can't see 'em
comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see 'em
comin down my eyes
So I gotta let the song cry
I can't see it
comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see it
comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
On repeat the
CD of Big's Me and My Bitch
Watchin Bonnie and Clyde
pretendin to be that shit
Empty gun in your hand sayin
Let me see that clip
Shoppin sprees
pull out your Visa quick
You know got very bad credit
you helped me lease that whip
You helped me get
the keys to that V dot 6
We was so happy poor but
when we got rich
That's when our signals
got crossed and we got flipped
Rather mine
I don't know what made me
leave that shit
Made me speed that quick
let me see that's it
was the cheese helped
them bitches get amnesia quick
I used to cut up they buddies
now they sayin they love me
Used to tell they friends
I was ugly and
wouldn't touch me
Then I showed up
in that dubbed out buggy
And then they got fussy
and they don't remember that
And I don't remember you
You You You
I can't see it
comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see it
comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
Yeah I seen 'em
comin down your eyes
But I gotta make the song cry
I can't see it
comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
A face of stone
was shocked on the other
end of the phone
Word back home is that
you had a special friend
So what was oh
so special then
You have given away
without gettin at me
That's your fault how many
times you forgiven me
How was I to know
you was plain sick of me
I know the way a nigga
livin was whack
But you don't get a
nigga back like that
Shit I'm a man with pride
you don't do shit like that
You don't just pick up and
leave and leave me
sick like that
You don't throw away
what we had just like that
I was just fuckin them girls
I was gon' get right back
They say you can't turn
a bad girl good
But once a good
girl's goin bad
she's gone forever
And more forever
Shit I gotta live with the
fact I did you wrong forever
I can't see 'em
comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see 'em
comin down my eyes
So I gotta let the song cry
I know I seen 'em
comin down your eyes
But I gotta make the song cry
I can't see 'em
comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
It's fucked up girl

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
You take the clothes off my back
And I let you
You steal the food right out of my mouth
And I watch you eat it
I still don't know why
Why our love is so much
Oh...
You curse my name
In spite to put me to shame
Air all my laundry in the streets
Dirty or clean
Give it up for fame
But I still don't know why
Why I love it so much
Yeah

[Hook]
And Baby
It's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack the code
One day you screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you here, one day you there, one day you care
You're so unfair sipping from the cup
Till it runneth over, Holy Grail

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Blue told me to remind you niggas
Fuck that shit y'all talk about
I'm the shit, caught up in all these lights and cameras
But look what that shit did to Hammer
...it I like it
The bright lights is enticing
But look what it did to Tyson
All that money in one night
30 mill for one fight
But soon as all the money blows
All the pigeons take flight
Keep the fame, keep cheating on me
What I do, I took her back, fool me twice
That's my bad, I can't even blame her for that
Enough to make me to...
Momma please just get my bail
I know nobody to blame
Kurt Cobain, I did it to myself

[Brigde: Justin Timberlake]
And we all just entertainers (x2)
And we're stupid, and contagious

[Hook: Justin Timberlake]

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Now I got tattoos on my body
Psycho... in my lobby
I got haters in the paper
Photo shoots with paparazzi
Can't even take my daughter for a walk
See them by the corner store
I feel like I'm cornered off
Enough is enough
I'm calling this off
Who the fuck I'm kidding though?
I'm getting...
Sitting low
Sliding by
In that big body
Curtains all in my window
This fame hurt
But this chain works
I think back
You asked the same person
If this is all you had to deal with
...deal with
It, this... ain't work
This light work
Camera snapping, my eyes hurt
...dying back where I was birthed
...your iris and IRS
Get the... up off of your high horse
You got the... that...
Dry yours
Why you mad
Take the good with the bad
Don't throw that baby out with the bath water
You're still alive
Still that...
You survived
You still getting bigger...
Living the life
Vanilla wafers
In a villa
Illest... alive
Michael Jackson thriller

[Hook: Justin Timberlake]

[Outro]
Don't know why
Love you so much

[Mr. Hudson]
Let’s dance in style,
Let’s dance for a while,
Heaven can wait we’re
only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst,
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever,
We don't have the power
but we never say never,
Sitting in a sandpit,
Life is a short trip,
The music’s for the sad man,

[Chorus]
Forever young,
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever

[Jay-Z]
So we live a life like a video
When the sun is always out
and you never get old
And the champagne’s always cold
And the music is always good
And the pretty girls just happen
to stop by in the hood
And they hop their pretty ass
up on the hood of dat pretty ass car
Without a wrinkle in today
Cuz there is no tomorrow
Just some picture perfect day
To last a whole lifetime
And it never ends
Cos all we have to do is hit rewind
So lets just stay in the
moment, smoke some weed,
Drink some wine,
Reminisce talk some sh-t forever
[ Find more Lyrics on www.mp3lyrics.org/eQVV ]
young is in your mind
Leave a mark that can't erase
neither space nor time
So when the director yells cut,
I'll be fine,
I'm forever young…

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z]
Fear not when, fear not why,
Fear not much while were alive,
Life is for living not living up tight,
See ya somewhere up in the sky,
Fear not die, I'll be alive for a
million years, bye bye,
So not for legends, I'm forever young
My name shall survive
Through the darkest blocks,
over kitchen stoves,
Over Pyrex pots, my name
shall be passed down to
generations
While debating up in barber shops,
young slung, hung here,
Shorty, the n-gga from here
With a little ambition just
what we can become here,
And as the father passed his story
down to his sons ears,
Younger kid, younger every year, yeah
So if you love me baby this is
how you let me know.
don't ever let me go, that's
how you let me know, baby,

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z]
Slamming Bentley doors,
Hopping out of Porsche’s,
Popping up on Forbes lists, Gorgeous, Hold up,
N-ggas thought I lost it,
They be talking bullsh-t
I be talking more sh-t
They nauseous, Hold up,
I'll be here forever
You know, I'm on my fall sh-t,
And I ain't waiting for
closure, I will never forfeit,
Less than four bars,
Guru bring the chorus in,
Did you get the picture yet,
I'm painting you a portrait of young…

Skin is, skin, is
Skin black, my skin is black
My, black, my skin is yellow

Light nigga, dark nigga,
faux nigga, real nigga
Rich nigga, poor nigga,
house nigga, field nigga
Still nigga, still nigga
I like that second one
Light nigga, dark nigga,
faux nigga, real nigga
Rich nigga, poor nigga,
house nigga, field nigga
Still nigga, still nigga

OJ like, I'm not black, I'm OJ okay

House nigga, don't fuck with me
I'm a field nigga, go shine cutlery
Go play the quarters
where the butlers be
I'ma play the corners
where the hustlers be
I told him, Please don't die
over the neighborhood
That your mama rentin'
Take your drug money
and buy the neighborhood
That's how you rinse it
I bought every V12 engine
Wish I could take it
back to the beginnin'
I coulda bought a place
in Dumbo before it was Dumbo
For like 2 million
That same building
today is worth 25 million
Guess how I'm feelin' Dumbo

Light nigga, dark nigga,
faux nigga, real nigga
Rich nigga, poor nigga,
house nigga, field nigga
Still nigga, still nigga
Light nigga, dark nigga,
faux nigga, real nigga
Rich nigga, poor nigga,
house nigga, field nigga
Still nigga, still nigga

You wanna know
what's more important
than throwin' away money
at a strip club Credit
You ever wonder
why Jewish people own
all the property in America
This how they did it

Financial freedom my only hope
Fuck livin' rich and dyin' broke
I bought some artwork
for 1 million
2 years later, that shit
worth 2 million
Few years later, that
shit worth 8 million
I can't wait to give this s
hit to my children
Y'all think it's bougie,
I'm like, it's fine
But I'm tryin' to give you a million
dollars worth of game for $999
I turned that 2 to a 4, 4 to an 8
I turned my life into a nice
first week release date
Y'all out here still takin'
advances, huh
Me and my niggas takin'
real chances, uh
Y'all on the 'Gram holdin'
money to your ear
There's a disconnect,
we don't call
that money over here, yeah

Light nigga, dark nigga,
faux nigga, real nigga
Rich nigga, poor nigga,
house nigga, field nigga
Still nigga, still nigga
Light nigga, dark nigga,
faux nigga, real nigga
Rich nigga, poor nigga,
house nigga, field nigga
Still nigga, still nigga

[Jay-Z]

Uh, uhh, listen

First the Fat Boys break up,
now every day I wake up

Somebody got a problem with Hov'

Whassup y'all niggaz all fed up cause
I got a little cheddar

and my records movin out the sto'?

Young fucks spittin at me,
young rappers gettin at me

My nigga Big predicted the shit exactly

"Mo' Money, Mo' Problems"
gotta move carefully

Cause faggots hate when
you gettin money like airfleets

Yung'uns ice-grillin me,
ohh - you not feelin me?

Fine; it cost you nothin - pay me no mind

Look, I'm on my grind cousin,
ain't got time for frontin

Sensitive thugs, y'all all need hugs

Damn though mans I'm just tryin do me

If the record's two mill'
I'm just tryin move three

Get a couple of chicks,
get 'em to try to do E

Hopefully they'll menage before
I reach my garage

I don't want much,
fuck I drove every car

Some nice cooked food,
some nice clean drawers

Bird-ass niggaz I don't mean to ruffle y'all

I know you waitin in the wing but
 I'm doin my thing

Where's the love?


"Ain't no love, in the heart of the city.."

I said where's the love?

"Ain't no love, in the heart of town.."

Yeah..


And then the Fugees gon' break up,
now everyday I wake up

Somebody got somethin to say

What's all the fuckin fussin for?
Because I'm grubbin more

and I pack heat like I'm the oven door?

Niggaz pray and pray on my downfall

But everytime I hit the ground
I bounce up like roundball

Now I don't wanna have to kill sound(?)

Don't wanna have to cock back the
 four pound bald

Look scrapper
I got nephews to look after

I'm not lookin at you dudes,
I'm lookin past ya

I thought I told you characters
I'm not a rapper

Can I live? I told you in ninety-six

that I came to take this shit and I did,
handle my biz

I scramble like Randall with his

cut in hand but the only thing
runnin is numbers fam

Jigga held you down six summers; damn,
where's the love?


"Ain't no love, in the heart of the city.."

Niggaz, where's the love?

"Ain't no love, in the heart of town.."

Holla at me!!

"Ain't no love" (take 'em to church)
"in the heart of the city.."

Uh, uh, uh - my nigga where's the love?

"Ain't no love, in the heart of town.."

Fuck


Then Richard Pryor go and burn up,
and Ike and Tina Turner break up

Then I wake up to more bullshit

You knew me before records,
you never disrespected me

Now that I'm successful you'll pull this shit

Nigga I'll step on your porch, step to your boss

Let's end the speculation, I'm talkin to alla y'all

Males shouldn't be jealous that's a female trait

Whatchu mad cause
you push dimes and he sell weight?

Y'all don't know my expenses,
I gotta buy a bigger place

Hehehe, and more baggies,
why you all aggie?

Nigga respect the game, that should be it

What you eat don't make me shit
where's the love?


Where's the love?


"Ain't no love, in the heart of the city.."

"Ain't no love, in the heart of town.."

"Ain't no love, in the heart of the city.."

"Ain't no love, in the heart of town.."

"Ain't no love, in the heart of the city.."

"Ain't no love, in the heart of town.."


"Ain't no love.."

If you havin girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch aint one
I got the Rap Patrol on the gat patrol
Foes that wanna make sure my caskets closed
Rap critics that say hes Money, Cash, Hoes
Im from the hood stupid, what type of facts are those?
If you grew up with holes in your zapatoes
Youd celebrate the minute you was havin dough
Im like fuck critics, you can kiss my whole asshole
If you dont like my lyrics, you can press fast forward
Got beef with radio if I dont play they show
they dont play my hits - well I dont give a shit, SO!
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give em more cash for ads, fuckers!
I dont know what you take me as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay-Z has
Im from, rags to riches, niggaz I aint dumb
I got 99 problems, but a bitch aint one - hit me!

99 problems but a bitch aint one
If you havin girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch aint one - hit me!

The year is ninety-four, in my trunk is raw
In my rearview mirror is the motherfuckin law
Got two choices yall, pull over the car or (hmm)
bounce on the Devil, put the pedal to the floor
And I aint tryin to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars, I can fight the case
So I, pull over to the side of the road
Son do you know why Im stoppin you for?
Cause Im young and Im black and my hats real low
Or do I look like a mindreader sir? I dont know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some mo?
Well you was doin fifty-five in the fifty-four;
license and registration and step out of the car -
are you carryin a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are
I aint steppin out of shit, all my papers legit
Well do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?
Well my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back
And I know my rights, so you gon need a warrant for that
Arent you sharp as a tack! You some type of
lawyer or somethin, somebody important or somethin?
Child I aint passed the bar, but I know a little bit
Enough that you wont illegally search my shit
Well well see how smart you are when the canine comes
I got 99 problems, but a bitch aint one - hit me!

99 problems but a bitch aint one
If you havin girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch aint one - hit me!

99 problems but a bitch aint one
If you havin girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch aint one - hit me!

Now once upon a time, not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strongarm a hoe
This is not a hoe in the sense of havin a pussy
But a pussy havin no God damn sense, try an push me
I try to ignore him, talk to the Lord
Pray for him, but some fools just love to perform
You know the type, loud as a motorbike
But wouldnt bust a grape in a fruit fight
And only thing thats gon happen is Ima get to clappin and
he and his boys gon be yappin to the Captain
And there I go, trapped in the Kit-Kat again
Back through the system with the riff-raff again
Fiends on the floor, scratchin again
Paparazzis with they cameras, snappin them
D.A. try to give a nigga shaft again
Half a mill for bail cause Im African
All because this fool was harassin them
Tryin to play the boy like hes saccharin
But aint nuttin sweet bout how I hold my gun
I got 99 problems B and a bitch aint one - hit me!

99 problems but a bitch aint one
If you havin girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch aint one - hit me!

99 problems but a bitch aint one
If you havin girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch aint one - hit me!

.. Whoo! Whoo! Uh, uh
Havin girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems and a bitch aint one, ha ha!
You crazy for this one Rick! Its your boy!

[Intro: Hannah Williams]
Do I find it so hard
When I know in my heart
I'm letting you down every day
Letting you down every day
Why do I keep on running away?

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Look, I apologize,
often womanize
Took for my child to be born
See through a woman's eyes
Took for these natural twins
to believe in miracles
Took me too long for this song
I don't deserve you
I harass you out in Paris
"Please come back to Rome,"
you make it home
We talked for hours
 when you were on tour
“Please pick up the phone,
pick up the phone”
I said, “Don't embarrass me,”
instead of “Be mine”
That was my proposal
for us to go steady
That was your 21st birthday
You mature faster than me,
I wasn't ready
So I apologize
I seen the innocence
leave your eyes
I still mourn this death and
I apologize for
all the stillborns
'Cause I wasn't present,
your body wouldn't accept it
I apologize to
all the women whom I
Toyed with your emotions
because I was emotionless
And I apologize 'cause
at your best you are love
And because I fall short
of what I say I'm all about
Your eyes leave with
the soul that your body
once housed
And you stare blankly
into space
Thinkin' of all the time,
you wasted it on
all this basic shit
So I apologize

[Chorus: Hannah Williams]
I'm never gonna treat you
I'm never gonna treat
you like I should

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
I apologize
Our love was one for the ages
and I contained us
And all this ratchet shit
 and we more expansive
Not meant to cry and die
alone in these mansions
Or sleep with our
back turned
We supposed to vacay 'til
our backs burn
We're supposed to laugh
'til our heart stops
And then meet in a space
where the dark stop
And let love light the way
Like the men before me,
I cut off my nose to
spite my face
I never wanted another
woman to know
Something about me
that you didn't know
I promised, I cried,
I couldn't hold
I suck at love,
I think I need a do-over
I will be emotionally available
if I invited you over
I stew over,
what if you over my shit?

[Chorus: Hannah Williams]
I'm never gonna treat you
I'm never gonna treat
 you like I should

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
And if my children knew,
I don't even know
what I would do
If they ain't look
at me the same
I would prob'ly die
with all the shame
"You did what with who?"
What good is a menage
a trois when you have
 a soulmate?
"You risked that for Blue?"
If I wasn't a superhero
in your face
My heart breaks for the day
I have to explain my mistakes
And the mask goes away,
and Santa Claus is fake
And you go online and see
For Blue's tooth,
the tooth fairy didn't pay

[Chorus: Hannah Williams]
I'm never gonna treat
you like I should

Intro:
It doesn't matter if you love him, or capital h-i-m
Just put your paws up
'Cause you were born this way, baby


Verse:
My mama told me when I was young
We are all born superstars
She pulled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
'There's nothin wrong with lovin who you are'
She said, 'cause he made you perfect, babe'
'So hold your head up girl and you'll go far,
Listen to me when I say'


Chorus:
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause god makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way


Post-chorus:
Ooo there ain't no other way
Baby I was born this way
Baby I was born this way
Ooo there ain't no other way
Baby I was born-
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way
Don't be a drag -just be a queen
Don't be a drag -just be a queen
Don't be a drag -just be a queen
Don't be!


Verse:
Give yourself prudence
And love your friends
Subway kid, rejoice your truth
In the religion of the insecure
I must be myself, respect my youth
A different lover is not a sin
Believe capital h-i-m (hey hey hey)
I love my life I love this record and
Mi amore vole fe yah (love needs faith)


Repeat chorus + post-chorus


Bridge:
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Whether you're broke or evergreen
You're black, white, beige, chola descent
You're lebanese, you're orient
Whether life's disabilities
Left you outcast, bullied, or teased
Rejoice and love yourself today
'Cause baby you were born this way
No matter gay, straight, or bi,
Lesbian, transgendered life
I'm on the right track baby
I was born to survive
No matter black, white or beige
Chola or orient made
I'm on the right track baby
I was born to be brave


Repeat chorus


Outro/refrain:
I was born this way hey!
I was born this way hey!
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way hey!
I was born this way hey!
I was born this way hey!
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way hey

Wish I could
I could have said goodbye
I would have said
what I wanted to
Maybe even cried for you

If I knew it would be
the last time
I would have broke
my heart in two
Tryin' to save a part of you

Don't want to feel another touch
Don't want to start another fire
Don't want to know another kiss
No other name falling off my lips
Don't want to give my heart away
To another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
No I'll never love again
I'll never love again
Ooouuu ooou oou

Oh

When we first met
I never thought that
I would fall
I never thought that
I'd find myself lyin' in your arms
Mmmm mmmm
And I wanna pretend that
it's not true oh baby
that you're gone
Cause my world keeps
 turnin' and turnin' and turnin'
and I'm not movin' on

Don't want to feel another touch
Don't want to start another fire
Don't want to know another kiss
No other name falling off my lips
Don't want to give my heart away
To another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
No I'll never love

I don't wanna know this feeling
unless it's you and me
I don't wanna waste a moment
Hoooo ouuu
And I don't wanna give somebody
else the better part of me
I would rather wait for you
Hoooo ouuu

Don't want to feel another touch
Don't want to start another fire
Don't want to know another kiss
Baby unless they are your lips
Don't want to give my heart
away to another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
Oooo I'll never love again
Love again
I'll never love again
I'll never love
Again

I won't I won't I swear I can't
I wish I could but I just won't
I'll never love again
I'll never love
Again
Who oo oo oo oo
Hmmm

That Arizona sky
Burnin' in your eyes
You look at me and babe
I wanna catch on fire
It’s buried in my soul
Like California gold
You found the light in me
that I couldn’t find

So when I'm all choked up
and I can't find the words
Every time
we say goodbye baby it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

Lovers in the night
Poets tryin' to write
We don't know how to rhyme
but damn we try
But all I really know
You're where I wanna go
The part of me
that's you will never die

So when I'm all choked up
and I can't find the words
Every time
we say goodbye baby it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

Oh yeah
I don't wanna be
just a memory baby yeah

Oo oo oo oo oo oo oo
Oo oo oo oo hoo hoo hoo
Oo oo oo oo hoo hoo
hooooooooo

So when I'm all choked up
and I can't find the words
Every time
we say goodbye baby it hurts
When the sun goes down
and the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way
Way yeah

When you look at me
and the whole world fades
I'll always remember us this way

Oouuu hmmmm
Ooouuu hmmmmmm

You're the one that I've been waiting for
Gotta quit this cryin', nobody's gonna
Heal me if I don't open the door
Kinda hard to believe,

Now, it's time to free me from the chain
I gotta find that peace, is it too late or
Could this love protect me from the pain?
I would battle for you
(Even if I break in two)

Freak out, I freak out, I freak out,

That Arizona sky
Burnin' in your eyes
You look at me and babe
I wanna catch on fire
It’s buried in my soul
Like California gold
You found the light in me
that I couldn’t find
So when I'm all choked up
and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye
baby it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way
Lovers in the night
Poets tryin' to write
We don't know how
to rhyme but damn we try
But all I really know
You're where I wanna go
The part of me that's you
will never die
So when I'm all choked up
and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye
baby it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way
Oh yeah
I don't wanna be
just a memory baby yeah
Oo oo oo oo oo oo oo
Oo oo oo oo hoo hoo hoo
Oo oo oo oo hoo hoo hooooooooo
So when I'm all choked up
and I can't find the words
Every time we say
goodbye baby it hurts
When the sun goes down
and the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way
Way yeah
When you look at me
and the whole world fades
I'll always remember us this way
Oouuu hmmmm
Ooouuu hmmmmmm

Wish I could
I could have said goodbye
I would have said what I wanted to
Maybe even cried for you

If I knew it would be the last time
I would have broke my heart in two
Tryin to save a part of you

Dont want to feel another touch
Dont want to start another fire
Dont want to know another kiss
No other name falling off my lips
Dont want to give my heart away
To another stranger
Or let another day begin
Wont even let the sunlight in
No Ill never love again
Ill never love again
Ooouuu ooou oou

I never thought that I would fall
I never thought that Id find
myself lyin in your arms
Mmmm mmmm
And I wanna pretend that

Cause my world keeps turnin
and turnin and turnin and
Im not movin on

Dont want to feel another touch
Dont want to start another fire
Dont want to know another kiss
No other name falling off my lips
Dont want to give my heart away
To another stranger
Or let another day begin
Wont even let the sunlight in
No Ill never love

I dont wanna know this feeling
unless its you and me
I dont wanna waste a moment
Hoooo ouuu
And I dont wanna give somebody
else the better part of me
I would rather wait for you
Hoooo ouuu

Dont want to feel another touch
Dont want to start another fire
Dont want to know another kiss
Baby unless they are your lips
Dont want to give my heart

Or let another day begin
Wont even let the sunlight in
Oooo Ill never love again

Again

I wish I could but I just wont
Ill never love again

You're giving me
a million reasons
to let you go
You're giving me
a million reasons
to quit the show
You're givin' me
a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

If I had a highway
I would run for the hills
If you could find a dry way
I'd forever be still
But you're giving me
a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

I bow down to pray
I try to make the
worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his
worn out leather
I've got a hundred million
reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one
good one to stay

Head stuck in a cycle
I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped
breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me
a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

And if you say something
that you might even mean
It's hard to even fathom
which parts I should believe
'Cause you're giving me
a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

I bow down to pray
I try to make the
worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his
worn out leather
I've got a hundred million
reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one
good one to stay

Hey, ehh, ehh, eyy
Baby I'm bleedin', bleedin'
Stay, ehh, ehhy
Can't you give me what I'm
needin', needin'
Every heartbreak makes it
hard to keep the faith
But baby, I just need one
good one, good one,
good one, good one,
good one, good one

When I bow down to pray
I try to make the
worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his
worn out leather
I've got a hundred million
reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one
good one, good one
Tell me that you'll be the
good one, good one
Baby, I just need one
good one to stay

When I find myself
in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
let it be
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right
in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom
let it be

Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
let it be

And when the
broken-hearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer
let it be
For though
they may be parted
There is still a chance
that they will see
There will be an answer
let it be

Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Yeah,
there will be an answer
let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
let it be

Let it be, let it be
Ah, let it be, yeah,
let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
let it be

And when the night is cloudy
There is still a light
that shines on me
Shine on until tomorrow
let it be
I wake up to the
sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
let it be

Let it be, let it be
Let it be, yeah, let it be
Oh, there will be an answer
let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, yeah, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
let it be

Yesterday
all my troubles
seemed so far away
Now it looks as though
they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Suddenly
I'm not half the man
I used to be
There's a shadow
hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

Why she had to go
I don't know
she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
now I long for yesterday

Yesterday
love was such an easy
game to play
Now I need a place
to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Why she had to go
I don't know
she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
now I long for yesterday

Yesterday
love was such an easy
game to play
Now I need a place
to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm

Remember
to let her into your heart
Then you can start

Who knows how long
I've loved you
You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime
If you want me to I will

For if I ever saw you
I didn't catch your name
But it never
really mattered
I will always feel the same

Love you
forever and forever
Love you
with all my heart
Love you
whenever we're together
Love you
when we're apart

And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so
I can hear you
Make it easy
to be near you
For the things you do
endear you to me
You know I will

I will

There are places I remember
All my life though some
have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone
and some remain
All these places have
their moments
With lovers and friends
I still can recall
Some are dead and
some are living
In my life I've loved them all

But of all these
friends and lovers
There is no one
compares with you
And these memories
lose their meaning
When I think of love
as something new
Though I know
I'll never lose affection
For people and things
that went before
I know I'll often stop
and think about them
In my life I love you more

Though I know
I'll never lose affection
For people and things
that went before
I know I'll often stop
and think about them
In my life I love you more

In my life I love you more

He got hair down

He got muddy water,

He say, "One and one,

Yeah, come together
Yeah, come together
Yeah, come together
Yeah, come together
Yeah, come together
Yeah, oh
Come together
Yeah, come together

Words are flowing out
like endless
rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly
as they slip away
across the universe
Pools of sorrow
waves of joy are drifting
through my opened mind
Possessing and
caressing me
Jai Guru Deva OM
Nothing's gonna
change my world
Nothing's gonna

Nothing's gonna
change my world
Nothing's gonna
change my world
Images of broken light
which dance before me
like a million eyes
They call me on and on
across the universe
Thoughts meander
like a restless
wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly
as they make
their way
across the universe
Jai Guru Deva OM
Nothing's gonna
change my world
Nothing's gonna
change my world
Nothing's gonna
change my world
Nothing's gonna
change my world
Sounds of laughter
shades of life are ringing
through my open ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love
which shines around me
like a million suns
It calls me on and on
across the universe
Jai Guru Deva OM
Nothing's gonna
change my world
Nothing's gonna
change my world
Nothing's gonna

Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies
and see
I'm just a poor boy
I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come
easy go
Little high, little low
Any way the wind blows
doesn't really matter to me
to me
Mama just killed a man
Put a gun
against his head
pulled my trigger
now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone
and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again
this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on
as if nothing really matters
Too late
my time has come
Sends shivers down
my spine
body's aching all the time
Goodbye, ev'rybody
I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind
and face the truth
Mama, ooh
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish

Thunderbolt and lightning
very, very fright'ning me
(Galileo.) Galileo
(Galileo.) Galileo
Galileo figaro
Magnifico.
I'm just a poor boy

Spare him his life

So you think you can stone me
and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me
and leave me to die
Oh, baby, can't do this to me

Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me find me find me

I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio
You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds, invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly
So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there

You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (Radio)

All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio, blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you

We watch the shows, we watch the stars
On videos for hours and hours
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years
Let's hope you never leave, old friend
Like all good things, on you, we depend
So, stick around 'cause we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual

You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio

All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you
Loves
You, oh

Oh, lets go
Steve walks warily down the street
With the brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound
but the sound of his feet,
Machine guns ready to go
Are you ready, hey,
are you ready for this?
Are you hanging on the
edge of your seat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone,
and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust
How do you think
I'm going to get along
Without you when youre gone?
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own
Are you happy, are you satisfied?
How long can you stand the heat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone,
and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust
Hey
Oh take it
Bite the dust
Bite the dust
Hey
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust oww
Another one bites the dust hey hey
Another one bites the dust eh eh
Oh shooter
There are plenty of ways
that you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him, you can cheat him
You can treat him bad
and leave him when hes down
But I'm ready, yes, I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating to the sound
of the beat oh yeah
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone,
and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust
Oh shooter hey hey, all right

I won't fix, I'd rather weep
I'm lost then I'm found
But it's torture bein' in love
I love when you're around
But I fuckin' hate when you leave

?ggas will be like
＂Yo, these niggas is

Like, these niggas is
really wildin',
you know what I'm sayin'?＂
Like, we ain't playin'
with y'all niggas, man,
ya heard?
Sometimes you just gotta catch
chlamydia on these niggas,
G-shit
You know what I'm sayin'?
Gonorrhea, all that shit
All of that shit
I catch all diseases
in the world
So the world don't have
no more diseases, you feel me?
G-shit
Yeah, yeah
P. Soul on the track

I'm as real as they come,
they feel it, get numb
You think you got a little buzz,
so now you can't get stung?
I keep a razor blade
tucked on me, under my tongue
Don't let me have to tell
these niggas
about the city I'm from
It's Brooklyn,
be the home of the hardest ever
Where them niggas don't aim,
they just palm Berettas
And bomb whatever,
say we don't move calmly, never
This for my niggas trapped
in cells like salmonella
Look, I could do this shit
with no effort
No pressure, no gimmick shit,
no radio records
Just textbook rhyme style
with the raw texture
Punchlines, right hooks,
now that's a trifecta
No more free lectures,
I'm taxin' these niggas extra
This the Pro of all Eras,
he's back in your sector
So, might be best
to protect your neck
Or profess your debt to the god,
he might bless ya

Murder these flows like
I murder these hoe ass niggas
Where the fuck is
your energy, bro?
Make your nigga deepthroat
a Desert Eagle
If he try me like a ho,
pussy boy, that's on my soul
Make my flow shapeshift,
cold expression like a facelift
I could probably swing like
eight grips if you talkin'
all that ape shit
I'm not talkin' YMBAPE shit,
but I'm bangin'
on my chest, bitch
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Travelin' through
the infinity, uh
You not that nigga,
pretend to be, uh
All that bullshit
do not get to me, uh
I am a spirit, an entity, uh
You just wanna suck
all my energy, uh
I am the realest
since Kennedy, uh
You pussy ass niggas
fuckin' suck,
you sound the same
I spit the pain, that's why
the young niggas feel the same
They know I bang, I pull
a fuckin' pistol out the
Range and act insane

I spent years at the crib,
so I don't feel the pain no more
I don't feel the pain no more
I gotta get it how I live,
I don't feel the pain no more
I don't feel the pain no more
I spent years at the crib,
so I don't feel the pain no more
I don't feel the pain no more
I gotta get it how I live,
so I don't feel the pain no more
I don't feel the pain no
I spent years at the crib,
so I don't feel the pain no more
So I don't feel the pain no more
I gotta get it how I live,
I don't feel the pain no more
I don't feel the pain no more
I spent years at the crib
so I don't feel the pain no more
I don't feel the pain no more
I gotta get it how I live,
so I don't feel the pain no more
I don't feel the pain no more
[Intro]
Yeah

[Chorus]
Shawty, know you bad...
word? So profane
Somethin' like a bad, word,
want your love
Call me when you can, girl
Goin' up, goin' down,
in and out, turn around
Shawty, know you bad... word?
So profane
Somethin' like a bad,
word, want your love
Call me when you can, girl
Goin' up, goin' down, in and out,
turn around
Love you the way you movin' now

[Verse]
I might be insane, yeah
But I love the pain, yeah
Feel it in the brain, yeah-ahh
Realize she just want me hit it right
'Cause I get 'em goin' right

[Chorus]
Shawty, know you bad...
word? So profane
Somethin' like a bad, word,

Call me when you can, girl
Goin' up, goin' down,

(Luke White on the beat)

You ever seen a nigga hung
with a gold chain?
I'd rather sing about the same things
that we claim
Such is bashful
but niggas like a task force
Mobbin' on the streets
and robbin' stores in ski masks, bruh
Niggas ask for peace in a riot
then bring violence
'Cause it's a game of cat and mouse
and you gon' bleed silent
What's the justice in sayin', ＂Fuck it,＂
and grab the pump?
Then kill a woman with many children?
Makes you a chump
Look in all the stores you wreckin'
nigga, I reckon
Think about the people
who own it for 'bout a second
I know you got your problems
but brother, they got theirs
This is not a game
quit violence and grow a pair
But sure, you'd rather hear me say
＂Fuck the black prejudice
Let's murder different races
grow hatred, and form irrelevant
Views,” and etcetera, knives thrown
Damage 'em, lives blown
oblivion, all cold, oblivious
I won't dare say that
you should stop the fuckin' ignorance
Murder opps, killin' shit
I'd enjoy the thrill of it
Bathe in blood of officers
different corpses, offin' 'em
Auction 'em, don't you bark at 'em
murder 'em, never heard of 'em
I could preach the peace
but say, ＂Fuck it,＂
and preach the murder
'Cause this ain't fuckin' life that we livin'
go 'head and grab the extension
Give death another one
uncle, cousin, brother, son
Glory to all the chosen ones
that will rid you of innocence
But in a sense
innocent will soon behold the ignorance
Blasphemous, killin' our own
murderin' black

We see, I see, death before the children
White guys and white girls hanging
from the buildings
(We are the Ku Klux Klan, we hate)

Ayy Ayy Ayy
I'm like Bitch,
who is your mans
Ayy, can't keep
my dick in my pants
Ayy, my bitch
don't love me no mo'
Ayy, she kick me out,
I'm like vro
Ayy, that bitch
don't wanna be friends
Ayy, I gave her dick,
she amen
Ayy, she put her
 tongue on my dick
Ayy, look at my wrist, about ten
Ayy, just got
a pound of the boof
Ayy, brought that
shit straight to the booth
Ayy, Tommy my Hilfiger voots
Ayy, she said,
wan' fuck Bitch, I do
Ayy, you put a gun on my mans
Ayy, I put a hole in your parents
Ayy, I just got lean on my ksubis

Yah, fuck on me, yah

Look at me, fuck on me
Yah, look at me, fuck on me
Yah, ayy

I took a white
bitch to Starbucks
That little bitch
got her throat fucked
I like to rock out like I'm misfit
My emo bitch like her wrist slit
Curly hair bitch like I'm Corbin
Got, like, three bitches,
I'm Mormon
Skeet on your
main bitch's forehead
Don't want your
pussy, just want head

Look at me, fuck on me
Look at me, fuck on me
Look at me, fuck on me
Look at me, yah
Ayy, look at me, fuck on me
Look at me, fuck on me
Look at me, fuck on me
Look at me, yah

Why am I so in love?
Why am I so in love?
Why am I so in love?
I don't know why

Steady tryin' to maintain
Same things that
a blood bitch might frame
My brain can't fathom
what the hate say
He say, she say,
how 'bout me say?
Get the Vis-a,
had to tell the others A-S-A-P
What's that on my shawty wrist?
That's a AP
I'm the type to save a bitch, C-A-P-E
Feelin' like ET, flyin' out of the Addy
Fuckin' on shawty, she baddie,
'cause she was calmin' the addict
I mean I'm better than better,
maybe I'm lyin'
I'm sadder than most of y'all
with the money
and the freedom, nigga
What is money really worth
if it ain't love?
I'ma find a perfect balance,
 it's gon' take time
I heard shawty still in love
through the grapevine
Heard shawty still in love
through the grapevine
Heard shawty in love
through the grapevine

Mix a little bit of weed

I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today
I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

And you're probably
with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today
I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could
I ever love someone else?

And I know we weren't perfect
but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine
how you could be so okay now that
I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean
what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever now
I drive alone past your street

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know
you the way that I do
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you

And I know we weren't perfect
but I've never felt this way for no one
Oh, and I just can't imagine
how you could be so okay now that
I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean
what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever now
I drive alone past your street

Red lights
Stop signs
I still see your face
In the white cars
Front yards
Can't drive past the places
We used to
Go to
'Cause I still fucking love you, babe

Sidewalks
We crossed
I still hear your voice
In the traffic
We're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue
Know we're through
But I still fucking love you, babe

I know we weren't perfect
but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine
how you could be so okay now that
I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean
what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever now
I drive alone past your street

[Intro]
Ayy, woah
Ayy, ayy
Yeah

[Refrain]
I'm makin' a change today
The liquor been takin' the pain away
I heard you was givin' your chain away
That's kinda like givin' your fame away
What's wrong with you?
I sit in a box where the owners do
A boss is a role that I've grown into
I love you to death
but I told you the truth
I can't just be with you and only you

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I got one, Virgil got one
and that there is the only two
Man, how many times
have I shown improvement?
How many nights I been, woah
Swervin' them potholes,
not tryna fuck up the wheels
on the road, okay
Funny how life goes
He thought he was sick,
now he wipin' his nose, okay
Soon as you give 'em your soul
You blow up and they say
you sellin' your soul, okay
They want my life exposed,
they wanna know
about the highs and lows

[Chorus]
Well summer, all I did was rest, okay?
And New Year's,
all I did was stretch, okay?
And Valentine's Day, I had sex, okay?
We'll see what's 'bout to happen next
Okay? Okay? Okay?
We'll see what's 'bout to happen next
Okay? Okay? Okay?
We'll see
what's 'bout to happen, ayy, ayy
We'll see what's 'bout to happen, ayy
We'll see what's 'bout to happen

[Refrain]
I'm makin' a change today
The liquor been takin' the pain away
I heard you was givin' your chain away
That's kinda like givin' your fame away
What's wrong with you?
I sit in a box where the owners do
A boss is a role that I've grown into
I love you to death
but I told you the truth
I-

[Verse 2]
Ayy, yeah
I got one, lawyer got one
and that there is the only two
Man, how many times
have I told you the truth?
Man, how many nights I been, woah
Swervin' them potholes,
not tryna fuck up the wheels
or fuck up the deals
I'm posted in Stockholm, it's me,
the owls and the twins, it's only the real
I'm movin' way too humble
Weezy had handed it off,
I still got no fumbles
I'm on the hot one hundo, numero uno
This one ain't come with a bundle
I'm in the Wynn,
a million in chocolate chips
And that's just how my cookie crumble
I put a skirt on a whip
and a crown on the six
But there's no need to
dress up the numbers
Ayy, ayy, yeah
But I guess they must have they reasons
They wanna know how I'm livin'
my day-to-day life in the regular season

[Chorus]
Well summer, all I did was rest, okay?
And New Year's,
all I did was stretch, okay?
And Valentine's Day, I had sex, okay?
We'll see what's 'bout to happen next
Okay? Okay? Okay?
We'll see what's 'bout to happen next
Okay? Okay? Okay?
We'll see what's 'bout to happen, ayy, ayy
We'll see what's 'bout to happen, ayy
We'll see what's 'bout to happen

[Refrain]
I'm makin' a change today
The liquor been takin' the pain away
I heard you was givin' your chain away
That's kinda like givin' your fame away
What's wrong with you?
I sit in a box where the owners do
A boss is a role that I've grown into
I love you to death but I told you the truth
I-

I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I changed even
when I knew I never could
I know that I can't find nobody else
as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey

I get drunk, wake up, I'm wasted still
I realize the time that I wasted here
I feel like you can't feel the way I feel
I'll be fucked up if you can't be right here

Oh, oh, oh
I'll be fucked up if you can't be right here

I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I changed even
when I knew I never could
I know that I can't find nobody else
as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey
I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I changed even
when I knew I never could
I know that I can't find nobody else
as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey

When I'm away from you, I miss your touch
You're the reason I believe in love
It's been difficult for me to trust
And I'm afraid that I'ma fuck it up
Ain't no way that I can leave you stranded
'Cause you ain't never left me empty-handed
And you know that I know
that I can't live without you
So baby stay

Oh, oh, oh
I'll be fucked up if you can't be right here

I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I changed even
when I knew I never could
I know that I can't find nobody else
as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey
I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I changed even
when I knew I never could
I know that I can't find nobody else
as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey

There ain’t no gold
In this river
That I’ve been washing my hands in forever
I know there is hope
In these waters
But I can’t bring myself to swim
When I am drowning
In this silence baby let me in

Go easy on me baby
I was still a child
Didn’t get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose
What I chose to do
So go easy on me

There ain’t no room
For things to change
When we are both so deeply
Stuck in our ways
You can’t deny how hard I have tried
I changed who I was
To put you both first
But now I give up

I had good intentions
And the highest hopes
But I know right now
It probably doesn’t even show

Pullin' out the coupe at the lot
Told 'em fuck 12, fuck SWAT
Bustin' all the bales out the box
I just hit a lick with the box
Had to put the stick in a box, mmh
Pour up the whole damn seal,
I'ma get lazy
I got the mojo deals,
we been trappin' like the '80s
She sucked a nigga soul,
got the Cash App
Told 'em wipe a nigga nose,
say slatt, slatt
I won't never sell my soul,
and I can back that
And I really wanna know
when you wet wet

I was out back where the stash at
Cruise the city
in a bulletproof Cadillac (Skrrt)
'Cause I know these niggas
after where the bag at (Yeah)
Gotta move smarter,
gotta move harder
Nigga try to get me for my water
I'll lay his ass down, on my son,
on my daughter
I had the Draco with me, Dwayne Carter
Lotta niggas out here playin' ain't ballin'
I done put my whole arm in the rim,
Vince Carter (Yeah)
And I know probably
get a key for the quarter
Shawty barely seen in double C's,
I bought 'em
Got a bitch that's looking like Aaliyah,
she a model
I got the pink slip,
all my whips is key-less
Compton, I'm about to
get the key to the city
Patek like the sea, forget it

Pullin' out the coupe at the lot
Told 'em fuck 12, fuck SWAT
Bustin' all the bales out the box
I just hit a lick with the box
Had to put the stick in a box, mmh
Pour up the whole damn seal,
I'ma get lazy
I got the mojo deals,
we been trappin' like the '80s
She sucked a nigga soul,
got the Cash App
Told 'em wipe a nigga nose,
say slatt, slatt
I won't never sell my soul,
and I can back that
And I really wanna know
when you wet wet, hah

Hahaha, I been movin' 'em out
It's still up with me then,
he got the blues in the pouch (Yeah)
Took her to the forest,
put the wood in her mouth
Bitch don't wear no shoes in my house
The private I'm flyin' in,
I never wan' fly again
I'll take my chances in traffic (Yeah)
She suckin' on dick, no hands with it
I just made the Rollie
plain like a landing strip
I'm a 2020 president candidate
I done put a hundred
bands on Zimmerman, shit
I been movin' real gangster,
so that's why she picked a Crip
Shawty call me Crisco
'cause I pop my shit
Got it out the mud,
there's nothin' you can tell me, yeah
When I had the drugs,
I was street wealthy, yeah

Pullin' out the coupe at the lot
Told 'em fuck 12, fuck SWAT
Bustin' all the bales out the box
I just hit a lick with the box
Had to put the stick in a box, mmh
Pour up the whole damn seal,
I'ma get lazy
I got the mojo deals,
we been trappin' like the '80s
She sucked a nigga soul,
got the Cash App
Told 'em wipe a nigga nose,
say slatt, slatt
I won't never sell my soul,
and I can back that
And I really wanna know
when you wet wet

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I've been tryna call
I've been on my own
for long enough
Maybe you can show me
how to love, maybe
I'm going through withdrawals
You don't even
have to do too much
You can turn me on
with just a touch, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded
by the lights
No, I can't sleep until
I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning
in the night
Oh, when I'm like this,
you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2]
I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the
sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive,
baby, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
The city's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly
when you're gone

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded
by the lights
No, I can't sleep until
I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning
in the night
Oh, when I'm like this,
you're the one I trust

[Bridge]
I'm just walking by to let you know
(By to let you know)
I can never say it on the phone
(Say it on the phone)
Will never let you go this time
(Ooh)

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded
by the lights
No, I can't sleep until
I feel your touch
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

[Outro]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded
by the lights
No, I can't sleep until
I feel your touch

Woo, woo

How you pull up? I pull up
(Woo, Seth in the kitchen)

Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip
like I'm a cop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar?
This ain't no guitar, bitch

My Glock told me to promise
you gon' squeeze me (Woo)
You better let me go the day
you need me (Woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga
get to bustin' (Woo)
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop

It's safe to say I earned it
ain't a nigga gave me nothin'
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm ready to hop out
on a nigga, get to bustin'
Know you heard me say
＂You play, you lay,＂
don't make me push the button
Full of pain, dropped enough tears
to fill up a fuckin' bucket
Goin' for buckets, I bought a chopper
I got a big drum, it hold a hundred
ain't goin' for nothin'
I'm ready to air it out
on all these niggas, I can see 'em runnin'
Just talked to my mama
she hit me on FaceTime just to check up
on me and my brother
I'm really the baby, she know that
her youngest son was always guaranteed
to get the money (Okay, let's go)
She know that her baby
boy was always guaranteed
to get the loot
She know what I do, she know
'fore I run from a nigga
I'ma pull it out and shoot (Boom)
PTSD, I'm always waking up
in cold sweats like I got the flu
My daughter a G, she saw me kill a nigga
in front of her before the age of two
And I'll kill another nigga too
'Fore I let another nigga
do somethin' to you
Long as you know that
don't let nobody tell you different
Daddy love you (Yeah, yeah)

Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip
like I'm a cop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar?
This ain't no guitar, bitch
this a Glock (Woo)
My Glock told me to promise
you gon' squeeze me (Woo)
You better let me go the day
you need me (Woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga
get to bustin' (Woo, yeah)
And if I ain't enough
go get the chop (Yeah, yeah)

Keep a Glocky
when I ride in the Suburban
'Cause the codeine had
a young nigga swervin'
I got the mop, watch me wash
'em like detergent
And I'm ballin', that's why
it's diamonds on my jersey
Slide on opps' side and flip
the block back, yeah, yeah
My junior popped him
and left him lopsided, yeah, yeah
We spin his block, got the rebound
Dennis Rodman
Fool me one time
you can't cross me again
Twelve hundred horsepower
I get lost in the wind
If he talkin' on the yard
the pen' dogs'll take his chin
Maybach SUV for my refugees
Buy blocks in the hood
put money in the streets
I was solo when the opps
caught me at the gas station
Had it on me, thirty thousand
thought it was my last day
But they ain't even want no smoke
If I had to choose it
murder what she wrote

Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip
like I'm a cop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar?
This ain't no guitar, bitch
this a Glock (Woo)
My Glock told me to promise
you gon' squeeze me (Woo)
You better let me go the day
you need me (Woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga
get to bustin' (Woo)
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop

[Chorus: 24kGoldn]
Why you always in a mood?
Fuckin 'round, actin' brand new

But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playing by your rules
Everything look better with a view
Why you always in a mood?
Fuckin 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playing by your rules
Everything look better with a view

[Verse 1: iann dior]
I could never get attached
When I start to feel, I unattach
Somehow always end up feeling bad
Baby, I am not your dad,
it's not all you want from me
I just want your company
Girl, it's obvious, elephant in the room
And we're a part of it,
don't act so confused
And you love startin' it,

Now we arguin' in my bedroom

[Pre-Chorus: iann dior]

[Verse 2: 24kGoldn]
So why you tryin' to fake your
love on the regular
When you could be blowin' up

I won't ever let a shorty go and set me up
Only thing
I need to know is if you wet enough
I'm talking slick back, kick back,
gang sippin' fourties
You keep playin,
not another day with you shorty
Mismatch, bitch,
that was way before you know me
Got a lot of love,
 well you better save it for me

[Pre-Chorus: iann dior with 24kGoldn]
We play games of love to
avoid the depression

You got to keep me focused;

Pretty like Naomi, Cassie, plus Lauren
Spittin' like Weezy, Foxy, plus Lauryn
Ball like the ram, see, now that's Gordon

When they think they top the queen,

Word to my ass-shots, I'm so cheeky
Got 'em tryna palm
my ass like young Keke
Yes, I'm ghetto, word to Gepetto
Plus I'm little, where's my stiletto?
Tell Mike Jordan, send me my Retros
Used to be bi, but now I'm just hetero
Ain't talkin' medicine,

Ever since I put the cookie

He know this thing A1 like a felony
All he gotta do is say the word
like a spelling bee

Day to night to morning,

Take it, own it, steal it, fast
Boy, stop playing, grab my ass
Why you actin' like you shy? (Hot)
Shut it, save it, keep it pushin'
Why you beating 'round the bush?
Knowin' you want all this woman

Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young,
they assume you know nothing
Sequined smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young,
they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

And when I felt like
I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said
I was your favorite

A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young,
they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I

And when I felt like
I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said
I was your favorite

To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'
'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father, running like water, I
But when you are young,
they assume you know nothing

But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would
hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything
when I was young
I knew I'd curse you
for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once
the thrill expired
And you'd be standin'
in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

And when I felt like
I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said
I was your favorite

[Verse 1]
Tastes like strawberries
on a summer evenin'
And it sounds just like a song
I want more berries
and that summer feelin'
It's so wonderful and warm

[Pre-Chorus]
Breathe me in, breathe me out

Strawberries on a summer evenin'

Tastes like strawberries
on a summer evenin'
And it sounds just like a song
I want your belly

I don't know
if I could ever go without

[Chorus]
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high (Sugar)
Watermelon sugar high (Sugar)

Switchin' the positions for you
Cookin' in the kitchen and

Ah, yeah
Ah (Ah), yeah

I'm like the water when your
ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface,
but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would have known
from the look on your face
Lost in your current like
a priceless wine

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent
right to your wind
Head on the pillow,
I can feel you sneakin' in
'Cause if you are a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
But there was one prize I'd cheat to win

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train
could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow,
and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow,
and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger
than a '90s trend

Wait for the signal,
and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places
where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should'a known
from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train
could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train
could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Hey, that's my man
That's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Baby, every bait-and-switch
was a work of art
That's my man
Hey, that's my man
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

You ain't sure yet, but I'm for ya'
All I could want, all I can wish for
Nights alone that we miss more
And days we save as souvenirs
There’s no time, I wanna make more time
And give you my whole life
I left my girl, I’m in my Yorker
Hate to leave her, call it torture
Remember when I couldn't hold her
Left the baggage for a mover

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I got my peaches out in Georgia
(Oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California
(That’s that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah

I get the feeling, so I'm sure (Sure)
Hand in my hand because I'm yours
I can’t, I can't pretend,
I can't ignore you're right for me
Don't think you wanna know just
where I've been, oh
Don't be distracted
The one I need is right in my arms (Oh)
Your kisses taste the sweetest with mine
And I'll be right here with you
'til end of time

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I got my peaches out in Georgia
(Oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California

[Verse 1]
I caught it bad yesterday
You hit me with a call to your place
Ain't been out in a while anyway
Was hopin' I could catch you throwin'
smiles in my face
Romantic talkin'?
You don't even have to try
You're cute enough
to fuck with me tonight
Lookin' at the table,
all I see is weed and white
Baby, you livin' the life, but nigga,
you ain't livin' right

[Pre-Chorus]
Cocaine and drinkin' with your friends
You live in the dark, boy,
I cannot pretend
I'm not fazed, only here to sin
If Eve ain't in your garden,
you know that you can

[Chorus]
Call me when you want,
call me when you need
Call me in the morning,
I'll be on the way
Call me when you want,
call me when you need

Mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm

[Verse 2]
Ayy, ayy
I wanna sell what you're buyin'
I wanna feel on your ass in Hawaii
I want that jet lag from fuckin' and flyin'
Shoot a child in your mouth
while I'm ridin'
Oh, oh, oh, why me?
A sign of the times every time that I speak
A dime and a nine,
it was mine every week
What a time, an incline,
God was shinin' on me
Now I can't leave
And now I'm actin' hella elite
Never want the niggas
that's in my league
I wanna fuck the ones
I envy, I envy

[Pre-Chorus]
Cocaine and drinkin'
with your friends
You live in the dark, boy,
I cannot pretend
I'm not fazed, only here to sin
If Eve ain't in your garden,

I do not care if you lyin'

Well good for you,
I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it
only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said
that you wanted to give me the world

And good for you,
I guess that you've been
working on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you,
she really helped
Now you can be a better
 man for your brand new girl

Well good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doing great out there
 without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that

I've lost my mind
I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected,
 I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Well good for you,
I guess you're getting everything you want
You bought a new car
and your career's really taking off
It's like we never even happened, baby
What the fuck is up with that?

And good for you,
 it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to
God I was the only
Person who ever got you
Well, screw that and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you
 know that I do

Well good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doing great out there without me,
baby
God, I wish that I could do that

I've lost my mind
I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected,
I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Maybe I'm too emotional
But your apathy's like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
Maybe I'm too emotional
Your apathy's like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all

Well good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doing great out there
without me, baby
Like a damn sociopath

I've lost my mind
I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected,
 I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Well good for you,
I guess you moved on really easily

I picked up another bag
Like fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin',
money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it
And we might have a child when I'm finished

[Verse 1]
Uh, I won't love a ho, after we fuck,
she can't get near me
Only bitch I give a conversation to is Siri
My pants Amiri, yes, I'm winnin', clearly
I'm the chosen one, seen my potential,
so they fear me
Lately I've been prayin', God, I wonder,
can You hear me?
Thinkin' 'bout the old me, I swear I miss you dearly
Stay down 'til you come up,
I've been stickin' to that theory
Every day a battle, I'm exhausted and I'm weary
Make sure I smile in public,
when alone, my eyes teary
I fought through it all, but that shit hurt me severely
I've been gettin' high to hide behind my insecurities
Takin' different pills, but I know it ain't gon'?

[Chorus]
Uh, copped a BMW, new deposit,
I picked up another bag
Like fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin',
money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it (Uh, uh)
And we might have a child when I'm finished

[Verse 2]
They say I'm Pac rebirth,
never put out a weak verse
Homicides when we lurk, I'ma step 'til my feet hurt
Weren't puttin' them streets first
White tees turned burgundy t-shirts
Lookin' for somethin' real, he stuck in a deep search
Anxiety killin' me, I just want to leave Earth
When they ask if I'm okay,
it just make everything seem worse
Try and explain your feelings,
sound like something you rehearsed
Stabbed me in my back with a clean smirk
Lookin' so deep into your eyes,
I can read your thoughts, so
Shut the fuck?, I mean, please don't talk
I done been through too much
and I don't need another loss
Put that on every war scar for every battle I fought

[Chorus]
Uh, copped a BMW, new deposit,
I picked up another bag
Like fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin',
money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it
And we might have a child when I'm finished

[Outro]
When I'm finished, when I'm finished

City talkin', we takin' notes
Tell 'em all to keep makin' posts
Wish he could, but he can't get close
OG so proud of me that he chokin' up
while he makin' toasts
I'm the type that you can't control,

Say your time is comin' soon,
but just like Oklahoma (Mmm)
Mine is comin' sooner (Mmm),
I'm just a late bloomer (Mmm)

[Verse 3: Billy Ray Cyrus]
Hat down, cross town,
livin' like a rockstar
Spent a lot of money
on my brand new guitar
Baby's got a habit, diamond
rings and Fendi sports bras
Ridin' down Rodeo
in my Maserati sports car
Got no stress,
I've been through all that
I'm like a Marlboro Man so I kick on back
Wish I could roll on back to
that old town road
I wanna ride 'til I can't no more

[Chorus: Lil Nas X & Billy Ray Cyrus]
Yeah, I'm gonna take
my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my
horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more

Comin' over in my direction
So thankful for that,
it's such a blessin', yeah
Turn every situation into heaven, yeah
Oh-oh, you are
My sunrise on the darkest day
Got me feelin' some kind of way
Make me wanna savor
every moment slowly, slowly
You fit me tailor-made,
love how you put it on
Got the only key,
know how to turn it on
The way you nibble on my ear,
the only words I wanna hear
Baby, take it slow
so we can last long

Oh! Tu,
tu eres el iman y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Solo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso
(Oh, yeah)
Ya, ya me esta gustando
mas de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo mas
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningun apuro

Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oido
Para que te acuerdes si
no estas conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo
todo un manuscrito
(Sube, sube, sube
Sube, sube)

Quiero ver bailar tu pelo,
quiero ser tu ritmo (Woah, woah)
Que le ensenes a mi boca (Woah, woah)
Tus lugares favoritos
(Favorito, favorito, baby)
Dejame sobrepasar
tus zonas de peligro (Woah, woah)
Hasta provocar tus gritos (Woah, woah)
Y que olvides tu apellido

Si te pido un beso, ven, damelo,
yo se que estas pensandolo
Llevo tiempo intentandolo,
mami, esto es dando y dandolo
Sabes que tu corazon
conmigo te hace bom, bom
Sabes que esa beba esta
buscando de mi bom, bom
Ven, prueba de mi
boca para ver como te sabe
Quiero, quiero,
quiero ver cuanto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa,
yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empecemos lento, despues salvaje

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Cuando tu me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Y es que esa belleza es
un rompecabezas
Pero pa' montarlo aqui tengo la pieza
Oye!

Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oido
Para que te acuerdes si no estas conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
(Sube, sube, sube
Sube, sube)

Quiero ver bailar tu pelo,
quiero ser tu ritmo (Woah, woah)
Que le ensenes a mi boca (Woah, woah)
Tus lugares favoritos
(Favorito, favorito, baby)
Dejame sobrepasar
tus zonas de peligro (Woah, woah)
Hasta provocar tus gritos (Woah, woah)
Y que olvides tu apellido

Despacito
This is how we do it down in Puerto Rico
I just wanna hear you screaming,
＂Ay, Bendito!＂
I can move forever cuando este contigo
Bailalo!

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Que le ensenes a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos
(Favorito, favorito, baby)
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Hasta provocar tus gritos (Fonsi)
Y que olvides tu apellido (D.Y.)
Despacito

Look, if you had one shot
or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
Yo

His palms are sweaty
knees weak, arms are heavy
Theres vomit on his sweater already
moms spaghetti
Hes nervous
but on the surface he looks
calm and ready to drop bombs,
But he keeps on forgetting
what he wrote down
The whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth
but the words wont come out
Hes choking how
everybodys joking now
The clocks run out
times up, over, bloah!

Snap back to reality
Oh there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
Hes so mad, but he wont
give up that Easy, no
He wont have it
he knows his whole backs to these ropes
It dont matter, hes dope
He knows that but hes broke
Hes so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home
thats when its
Back to the lab again, yo
This whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment
and hope it dont pass him

You better lose yourself
in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot
do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes
once in a lifetime yo
You better lose yourself
in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot
do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes
once in a lifetime yo
(You better)

The souls escaping
through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king
as we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring
but superstardoms
close to post mortem
It only grows harder
homie grows hotter
He blows. Its all over
These hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows
hes known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows
Hes grown farther from home
hes no father
He goes home and barely knows
his own daughter
But hold your nose
cause here goes the cold water
His hoes dont want him no more
hes cold product
They moved on
to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds
I suppose its old partner
but the beat goes on
Da da dum da dum da da

You better lose yourself
in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot
do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes
once in a lifetime yo
You better lose yourself
in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot
do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes
once in a lifetime yo
(You better)

No more games
I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfucking roof off
like two dogs caged
I was playing in the beginning
the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out
and booed off stage
But I kept rhyming
and stepped right into the next cypher
Best believe somebodys
paying the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
That I cant get by with my 9 to 5
And I cant provide the right type
of life for my family
Cause man
these goddamn food stamps
don't buy diapers
And its no movie
theres no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard
and its getting even harder
Trying to feed and water my seed, plus
Teeter totter caught up
between being a father
and a prima donna
Baby mama dramas screaming on and
Too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot
another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point
I'm like a snail
I've got to formulate a plot
or I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfucking option
failures not
Mom, I love you
but this trailers got to go
I cannot grow old in Salems lot
So here I go its my shot
Feet, fail me not,this may be the
only opportunity that I got

You better lose yourself
in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot
do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes
once in a lifetime yo
You better lose yourself
in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot
do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes
once in a lifetime yo
(You better)

You can do anything

I won't stop till I get em in

So gimmie the rhythm
and it'll be off with they clothes,
then bend over to the front
and touch your toes.
I left the jag and I took the roles,

I put em on foot patrol.
How you like me now,
when my pinky's valued over
three hundred thousand,
Lets drank you the one to please,
Ludacris fill cups like double d's.
Me and Ush once more and

but a freak in the bed to say

Maybe I'm out of my mind

Ok, now he was close
Tried to domesticate you
But you're an animal
Baby, it's in your nature

I know you want it
I know you want it
But you're a good girl
The way you grab me
Must wanna get nasty
Go ahead, get at me

What do they make dreams for
When you got them jeans on
What do we need steam for
You the hottest
bitch in this place
I feel so lucky,
you wanna hug me
What rhymes with hug me?
Hey!

Ok, now he was close
Tried to domesticate you
But you're an animal
Baby, it's in your nature
Just let me liberate you
You don't need no papers
That man is not your maker
And that's why I'm gon' take a

Good girl
I know you want it
I know you want it
I know you want it
You're a good girl
Can't let it get past me
You're far from plastic
Talk about getting blasted
I hate these blurred lines
I know you want it
I know you want it
I know you want it
But you're a good girl
The way you grab me
Must wanna get nasty
Go ahead, get at me

One thing I ask of you
Lemme be the one you
back that ass up to
From Malibu to Paris, boo
Had a bitch,
but she ain't bad as you
So, hit me up
when you pass through
I'll give you something
big enough to tear
your ass in two
Swag on 'em even
when you dress casual
I mean, it's almost unbearable
In a hundred years
not dare would I
Pull a Pharcyde,
let you pass me by
Nothin' like your last guy,
he too square for you
He don't smack that ass and
pull your hair like that
So I'm just watching and waitin'
For you to salute the
true big pimpin'
Not many women can
refuse this pimping
I'm a nice guy,
but don't get confused,
this pimpin'

Shake your rump
Get down, get up-a
Do it like it hurt, like it hurt
What you don't like work
Hey!

Baby, can you breathe
I got this from Jamaica
It always works for me
Dakota to Decatur
No more pretending
Cause now you're winning
Here's our beginning
I always wanted a

Good girl
I know you want it
I know you want it
I know you want it
You're a good girl
Can't let it get past me
You're far from plastic
Talk about getting blasted
I hate these blurred lines
I know you want it
I know you want it
I know you want it
But you're a good girl
The way you grab me
Must wanna get nasty
Go ahead, get at me

Everybody get up
Everybody get up
Everybody get up
Hey, Hey, Hey
Hey, Hey, Hey
Hey, Hey, Hey

Everybody get up, WOO!
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

(Hook: Charlie Puth)
It’s been a long day,
without you my friend
And I’ll tell you all
about it when I see you again
We’ve come a long way
from where we began
Oh I’ll tell you all
about it when I see you again
When I see you again

(Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa)
Damn, who knew
All the planes we flew
Good things we been through
That I’d be standing
right here talking to you
Bout another path
I know we loved to hit
the road and laugh
But something told me
that it wouldn’t last
Had to switch up look at things
different see the bigger picture
Those were the days
Hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place

(Pre-Hook: Wiz Khalifa)
How could we not talk about
family when family’s
all that we got?
Everything I went
through you were
standing by my side
And now you gon’
be with me for the last ride

(Hook: Charlie Puth)

(Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa)
First, you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong
And what’s small
turned to a friendship
A friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken
The love will never get lost
And when brotherhood come first
Then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached
So remember me when i’m gone

(Pre-Hook: Wiz Khalifa)

(Bridge: Charlie Puth)
So let the light
guide your way, yea
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home
Hoooooome

Hey, I was doing just fine
before I met you
I drink too much
and that's an issue
But I'm Ok
Hey, tell your friends
it was nice to meet them
But I hope
I never see them again

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city
in a broke down car
And four years, no calls
Now you're looking pretty
in a hotel bar
And I, I, I, I, I can't stop
No, I, I, I, I, I can't stop

So baby pull me closer
in the back seat
of your Rover
That I know
you can't afford
Bite that tattoo
on your shoulder
Pull the sheets
right off the corner
Of the mattress
that you stole
From your roommate
back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

You, look as good as
the day I met you
I forget just why I left you
I was insane
Stay, and play
that Blink-182 song
That we beat to death
in Tucson, OK

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city
in a broke down car
And four years, no call
Now I'm looking pretty
in a hotel bar
And I, I, I, I, I can't stop
No, I, I, I, I, I can't stop

So baby pull me closer
in the back seat
of your Rover
That I know
you can't afford
Bite that tattoo
on your shoulder
Pull the sheets
right off the corner
Of the mattress
that you stole
From your roommate
back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

So baby pull me closer
in the back seat
of your Rover
That I know
you can't afford
Bite that tattoo
on your shoulder
Pull the sheets
right off the corner
Of the mattress
that you stole
From your roommate
back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
No, we ain't
ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
No, we ain't
ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
No, we ain't
ever getting older (yeah)

We ain't
ever getting older (yeah)
No, we ain't
ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
No we ain't ever getting older

The club isn't the best place
to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends
at the table doing shots
drinking fast
and then we talk slow
you come over and start up
a conversation with
just me and trust me
I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand stop
put van the man on the jukebox
and then we start to dance
And now I'm singing like

Girl you know I want your love
Your love was handmade
for somebody like me
Come on now follow my lead
I may be crazy don't mind me
Say boy
let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and
put that body on me
Come on now follow my lead
Come come on now
follow my lead

I'm in love with the
shape of you
We push and pull
like a magnet do
Although my heart is
falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets
smell like you
Every day discovering
something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh I

Oh I

Oh I

Every day discovering

shape of you

One week in
we let the story begin
We're going out
on our first date
You and me are thrifty
So go all you can eat
Fill up your bag
and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours
and hours about
the sweet and the sour
And how your family's doing ok
leave and get in a taxi
then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver
make the radio play
and I'm singing like

Girl you know I want your love
Your love was handmade
for somebody like me
Come on now follow my lead
I may be crazy don't mind me
Say boy
let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and
put that body on me
Come on now follow my lead
Come come on now
follow my lead

Although my heart is

Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after
all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya,
but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming
about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt
before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you, I'm sorry
for everything that I've done
But when I call,
you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you, I'm sorry
for breaking your heart
But it don't matter,
it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me
to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you, I'm sorry
for everything that I've done
But when I call,
you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you, I'm sorry
for breaking your heart
But it don't matter,
it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

(Highs, highs, highs, highs,
lows, lows, lows, lows) Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs,
lows, lows, lows, lows) Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs,
lows, lows, lows, lows) Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs,
lows, lows, lows, lows)
Anymore

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you, I'm sorry
for everything that I've done
But when I call,
you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you, I'm sorry
for breaking your heart
But it don't matter,
it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
