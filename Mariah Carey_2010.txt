Treated me kind
Sweet destiny
Carried me through desperation
To the one that was waiting for me
It took so long
Still I believed
Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've
given to me

Prayed through the nights
Felt so alone
Suffered from alienation
Carried the weight on my own
Had to be strong
So I believed
And now I know I've succeeded
In finding the place I conceived
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've
given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given me
I've realized a dream
And I visualized
The love that came to be
Feel so alive
I'm so thankful that I've received
The answer that heaven
has sent down to me
You treated me kind
Sweet destiny
And I'll be eternally grateful
Holding you so close to me
Prayed through the nights
So faithfully
Knowing the one that I needed
Would find me eventually
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've
given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you
turned out to be
I had it all
But I let it slip away
Couldn't see I
treated you wrong
Now I wander around
Feeling down and cold
Trying to believe
that you're gone
Love takes time
To heal when you're
hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain Inside
'Cause love takes time
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here alone

Losing my mind
From this hollow in my heart
Suddenly I'm so incomplete
Lord I'm needing you now
Tell me how to stop the rain
Tears are falling down
endlessly
Love takes time
To heal when you're
hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain Inside
'Cause love takes time
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here alone
You might say
that it's over
You might say
that you don't care
You might say
you don't miss me
You don't need me
But I know that you do
And I feel that you do Inside
Love takes time
To heal when you're
hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain Inside
'Cause love takes time
I don't wanna be there
I don't wanna be there alone
You were so blind to let me go
You had it all but did not know
No one you'll ever find will be
Closer to all your dreams than me
Believing the grass would be greener
You told yourself
I just don't need her now
But I know you'll soon discover
You're never satisfied with any other
Someday Oo Someday
One you gave away will be the
only one you're wishing for
Someday, Someday hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay
cause baby I'm the one who's
keeping score
You'll change your mind and
call my name
As soon as you find they're
all the same
And when you find yourself alone
Don't come back crying
You should have known
Believe me I'm not pretending
It's not hard to predict
This ending now
'Cause I know you'll soon discover
You're needing me in spite of
all the others
Someday Oo Someday
One you gave away will be the
only one you're wishing for
Someday, Someday hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause baby
I'm the one who's keeping score
Someday Oo Someday
One you gave away will be the
only one you're wishing for
Someday, Someday hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause baby
I'm the one who's keeping score
Maybe now you just can't conceive
That there'll ever come a
time when you're cold and lonely
Baby, how could you ever believe
That another could replace me
The one and only
But when your down
In your time of need
And you're thinking that you
Might be coming back to own me
Just think again 'cause
I won't need your love anymore

Oo Someday
Someday Oo Someday
One you gave away will be
the only one you're wishing for
Someday, Someday hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause
baby I'm the one who's keeping score
Someday Oo Someday
One you gave away will be the
only one you're wishing for
Someday hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause
baby I'm the one who's keeping score
Someday Oo Someday
One you gave away will be the
only one you're wishing for
Someday hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay
cause baby I'm the one who's
keeping score
Once again we sit in silence
After all is said and done
Only emptiness inside us
Baby look what we've become
We can make a million promises
But we still won't change
It isn't right to stay together
When you only bring each other pain
I don't wanna cry Don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world
Could take us back
To where we used to be
Though I've given you
my heart and soul
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry

Too far apart to bridge the distance
But something keeps us
hanging on and on Pretending
not to know the difference
Denying what we had is gone
Every moment we're together
It's just breaking me down
I know we swore it was forever
But it hurts too much to stay
around I don't wanna cry
Don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world
Could take us back
To where we used to be
Though I've given you
my heart and soul
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry

All the magic's gone
There's just a shadow of a memory
Something just went wrong
We can't go on make believing
on make believing
'Cause I don't wanna cry
Don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world
Could take us back
To where we used to be
Though I've given you
my heart and soul
I've given you my heart and soul
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby I don't wanna cry

I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever
dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above
I feel good I feel nice
I've never felt so
Satisfied
I'm in love I'm alive
Intoxicated
Flying high
It like a dream
When you touch me tenderly
I don't know it's real
But I like the way I feel
Inside
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever
dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above
In the morning
When I rise
You are the first thing
On my mind
And in the middle
Of the night
I feel your heartbeat
Next to mine
I it feels like a dream
When you love me tenderly
I don't know if you're for real
But I like the way I feel
Inside
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever
dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever
dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above
You know the way
to make me lose control
When you're looking
into my eyes
You make me feel so
High High High High High

You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever
dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above
Higher emotions
Deeper than I've ever
dreamed of
emotions
Higher emotions
Deeper than I've ever
dreamed of
You emotions
You've got than feeling
Higher
woo oh yeah

oh yeah

There you are holding her hand
I am lost Dying to understand
Didn't I cherish you right
Don't you know you were my life
Even though I try I can't let go
Something in your eyes
Captured my soul
And every night
I see you in my dreams
You're all I know
I can't let go
Just cast aside
You don't even know I'm alive
You just walk on by
Don't care to see me cry
And here I am
Still holding on
I can't accept my world is gone
no no
Even though I try I can't let go
Something in your eyes
Captured my soul
And every night
I see you in my dreams
You're all I know
I can't let go
Do you even realize the sorrow
sorrow I have inside
everyday of my life
Do you know the way it feels
When all you have just dies
I try and try to
deny that I need you
But still you remain on my mind
Even though I try I can't let go
Something in your eyes
Captured my soul
And every night
I see you in my dreams
You're all I know
I can't let go
Even though I try I can't let go
Something in your eyes
Captured my soul
And every night
I see you in my dreams
You're all I know
I can't let go
Not more than
three short years ago
I was abandoned and alone
Without a penny to my name
So very young and so afraid
No proper shoes upon my feet
Sometimes
I couldn't even eat
I often
cried myself to sleep
But I had to keep on going
Never knowing
If I could take it
If I would make it
through the night
I held on to my faith
I struggled and I prayed
And now I've found my way
If you believe in
yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
Make it happen
And if you get down on your
knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
Make it happen
He's gonna make it happen
I know life can be so tough
And you feel like giving up
But you must be strong
Baby just hold on
Never find the answers
If you throw your life away
I used to
feel the way you do
Still I had to keep on going
Never knowing
If I could take it
If I would make it
through the night
I held on to my faith
I struggled and I prayed
And now
I've finally found my way
If you believe in
yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
Make it happen
You're gonna make it happen
And if you get down on your
knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
Make it happen
If you believe in
yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
Make it happen
And if you get down on your
knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
Make it happen
Make it happen

Make it
He's gonna make it
Make it
Oh make it

I held on to my faith
I struggled and I prayed
And finally found my way
If you believe in
yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
Make it happen
And if you get down on your
knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
Make it happen
If you believe in
yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
Make it happen
And if you get down on your
knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
Make it happen
I once was lost
But now I'm found
I got my feet
On solid ground
Thank you Lord
If you believe
Within your soul
Just hold on tight
And don't let go
You can make it
Make it happen
through the make it
Make it happen
gonna make it
gonna make it
gonna make it
If you believe in
yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
Make it happen
And if you get down on your
knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
Make it happen
If you believe in
yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
Make it happen
And if you get down on your
knees at night
And pray to the Lord

No I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way
The story goes
You always smile but in your eyes
Your sorrow shows
Yes it shows
No I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there
But then I let you go
And now it's only fair
That I should let you know
What you should know
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't give
I can't give anymore
Well I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way
The story goes
You always smile but in your eyes
Your sorrow shows

If living is without you...

If you're lonely
And need a friend
And troubles seem like
They never end
Just remember
to keep the faith
And love will be there
to light the way
Anytime you need a friend
I will be here
Never be alone again
So don't you fear
Even if you're miles away
I'm by your side
So don't you ever be lonely
Love will make it alright
When the shadows
are closing in
And your spirit diminishing
Just remember
you're not alone
And love will be there
To guide you home
Anytime you need a friend
I will be here
Never be alone again
So don't you fear
Even if you're miles away
I'm by your side
Don't you ever be lonely
Love will make it alright
If you just believe in me
I will love you endlessly
Take my hand
Take me into your heart
I'll be there forever baby
I won't let go
I'll never let go
Anytime you need a friend
I will be here
Never be alone again
So don't you fear
Even if you're miles away
I'm by your side
So don't you ever be lonely
It's alright

Never be alone again
So don't you fear

Anytime you need a friend

Or your face as you were leaving

And I I want to share

No one else will do
And your eyes
they tell me how much you care
Oh yes you will always be
my endless love

Two hearts
two hearts that beats as one
Our lives have just begun
If forever
I'll hold you close in my arms
I cant resist your charms
And love I'll be a fool for you
I'm sure you know I dont mind
cause baby baby

Oh I know I found in you
my endless love

Oh and love
I'll be that fool for you
I'm sure that you know I dont mind
And yes you'll be the only one

this love I have inside
And I'll give it all to you
my love my endless love
Oh when you walk by every night
Talking sweet and looking fine
I get kind of hectic inside
Oh baby I'm so into you
Darling if you only knew
All the things
flow through my mind
But it's just a
Sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I not close my eyes
You come and take me
On and on and on
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet sweet
fantasy baby

Images of rapture
Creep into me slowly
As you're going to my head
And my heart beats faster
When you take me over
Time and time and time again
But it's just a
Sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I not close my eyes
You come and take me
On and on and on
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet sweet
fantasy baby

Sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I not close my eyes
You come and take me
On and on and on
It's so deep in my day dreams
But it's just a sweet sweet
fantasy baby
I'm in heaven
With my boyfriend
My laughing boyfriend
There's no beginning and there
is no end
Feels like I'm dreaming but
I'm not sleeping
Sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I not close my eyes
You come and take me
On and on and on
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet sweet
fantasy baby
Sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I not close my eyes
You come and take me
On and on and on
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet sweet
fantasy baby
Sweet sweet fantasy baby
Sweet sweet fantasy baby
Sorry I never told you
All I wanted to say
And now it's
too late to hold you
'Cause you've flown away
So far away
Never had I imagined
Living without your smile
Feeling
and knowing you hear me
It keeps me alive
Alive
And I know you're shining down
on me from Heaven
Like so many friends
we've lost along the way
And I know eventually
we'll be together
One sweet day
Eventually
we'll sing in heaven
Darling I never showed you
Assumed you'd always be there
But I I took your presence
for granted
But I always cared
And I miss the love we shared
And I know you're shining down
on me from Heaven
Like so many friends
we've lost along the way
And I know eventually
we'll be together
One sweet day
Eventually
we'll sing in heaven
Although the sun will
never shine the same
I'll always
look to a brighter day
Lord I know
when I lay me down to sleep
You will always
listen as I pray
And I know you're shining
down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends
we've lost along the way
And I know eventually
we'll be together
One sweet day
And I know you're shining
down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends
we've lost along the way
And I know eventually
we'll be together
One sweet day
Eventually
we'll sing in heaven
Sorry I never told you
All I wanted to say
We were as one babe
For a moment in time
And it seemed everlasting
That you would always be mine
Now you want to be free
So I'll let you fly
Cause I know in my heart babe
Our love will never die
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy don't you know
you can't escape me
Ooh darling cause
you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling
this strong
No way you're ever gonna
shake me
Oh darling cause
you'll always be my baby

I aint gonna cry no
And I won't beg you to stay
If you're determined to
leave boy
I will not stand in your way
But inevitably
you'll be back again
Cause you know
in your heart babe
Our love will never end
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy don't you know
you can't escape me
Ooh darling cause
you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling
this strong
No way you're ever gonna
shake me
Oh darling cause
you'll always be my baby
I know that
you'll be back boy
When your days and
your nights
get a little bit colder
I know that
you'll be right back
Oh baby believe me
it's only a matter of time
time
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy don't you know
you can't escape me
Ooh darling cause
you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling
this strong
No way you're ever gonna
shake me
Oh darling cause

You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy don't you know

Ooh darling cause
you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling
this strong
No way you're ever gonna
shake me
Oh darling cause
you'll always be my baby
I didn't mean it
When I said
I didn't love you so
I should have held on tight
I never should let you go
I didn't know nothing
I was stupid
I was foolish
I was lying to myself
I could't fathom that
I would ever
Be without your love
Never imagined I'd be
Sitting here beside myself
Cause I didn't know you
Cause I didn't know me
But I thought
I knew everything
I never felt
The feeling that I'm feeling
Now that
I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch
and kiss your lips
Cause I don't have a choice
Oh what I wouldn't give
To have you lying by my side
Right here cause baby
When you left
I lost a part of me
It's still
so hard to believe
Come back baby please
Cause we belong together
Who else am I
gon' lean on
When times get rough
Who's gonna talk to me
on the phone
Till the sun comes up
Who's gonna take your place
There ain't nobody better
Oh baby baby
We belong together
I can't sleep at night
When you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Saying to me
If you think
you're lonely now
Wait a minute
This is too deep
too deep
I gotta change the station
So turn the dial
Trying to catch a break
And then I hear Baby face
I only think of you
And it's breaking my heart
I'm trying to keep
it together
But I'm falling apart
I'm feeling all out
of my element
I'm throwing things
crying
Trying to figure out
Where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected
in this song
It ain't even half of what
I'm feeling inside
I need you
Need you back in my life
baby
When you left I lost
a part of me
It's still
so hard to believe
Come back baby please
Cause we belong together
Who else am I
gon' lean on
When times get rough
Who's gonna talk to me
on the phone
Till the sun comes up
Who's gonna take your place
There ain't nobody better
Oh baby baby
We belong together baby
When you left
I lost a part of me
It's still
so hard to believe
Come back baby
please
Cause we belong together
Who am I gonna lean on
When times get rough
Who's gonna talk to me
Till the sun comes up
Who's gonna take your place
There ain't nobody better
Oh baby
baby
We belong together
I gotta shake you off
Cause the
loving ain't the same
And you keep on
playing games
Like you know
I'm here to stay
I gotta shake shake you off
Just like the Calgon
commercial that
really gotta get
up outta here
And go somewhere
I gotta shake you off
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates
all the love I give
I gotta shake shake you off
Gotta do what's best for me
Baby and that means I gotta
Shake you off
By the time you get
this message
It's gonna be too late
So don't bother paging me
Cause I'll be on my way
See I grabbed
all my diamonds and clothes
Just ask your
momma she knows
You're gonna miss me baby
Hate to say I told you so
Well at first I didn't know
But now it's clear to me
You would cheat with all
your freaks and lie
compulsively
So I packed up my
Louis Vuitton
Jumped in your
ride and took off
You'll never ever
find a girl
Who loves you more than me
I gotta shake you off
Cause the
loving ain't the same
And you keep on
playing games
Like you
know I'm here to stay
I gotta shake shake you off
Just like the Calgon
commercial that
really gotta get
up outta here
And go somewhere
I gotta shake you off
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates
all the love I give
I gotta shake shake you off
Gotta do what's best for me
Baby and that means I gotta
Shake you off
I gotta shake shake

I found out about a gang
Of your dirty little deeds
With this one and that one
By the pool
on the beach
in the streets
Heard y'all was
Hold up
my phone's breaking up
I'm a hang up
and call the
machine right back
I gotta
get this off of my mind
You wasn't worth my time
So leaving you behind
Cause I need a
real love in my life
Save this recording because
I'm never coming back home
Baby I'm gone
Don't cha know I gotta
I gotta shake you off
Cause the
loving ain't the same
And you keep on
playing games
Like you know
I'm here to stay
I gotta shake shake you off
Just like the Calgon
commercial that
really gotta get
up outta here
And go somewhere
I gotta shake you off
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates
all the love I give
I gotta shak shake you off
Gotta do what's best for me
Baby and that means I gotta
Shake you off
shake shake
shake shake shake it off

Cause the
loving ain't the same
And you keep on
playing games
Like you know
I'm here to stay
I gotta shake shake you off
Just like the Calgon
commercial that
Really gotta get
up outta here
And go somewhere
I gotta shake you off
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates
all the love I give
I gotta shak shake you off
Gotta do what's best for me
Baby and that means I gotta
Shake you off
I gotta shake you off
I gotta shak shake you off
I remember when you
used to be mine
Way back when
I was too naive to
love you right
But now if I only had
the opportunity
I would do anything
Because my heart
still believes
Maybe you could be
mine again
Maybe we could make
that dream for real
Like way back then
When love was
yours and mine
Maybe we could bring it
back to life

It's irrelevant to dwell
on the past
I'm accountable for
what went bad
And I mean that
But I keep on praying
for another chance
Just to have you back
Cause I've grown
And I know how to be
your everything
Maybe you could be
mine again
Maybe we could make
that dream for real
Like way back then
When love was
yours and mine
Maybe we could bring it
back to life
No no it ain't over yet
I just can't accept
the possibility
We weren't made for
each other's arms
I know you're my destiny
We can't erase
what was meant to be
Part of you and part of me
If we try one more time
Maybe somehow we'll survive
Maybe you could be
mine again
Maybe we could make
that dream for real
Like way back then
When love was
yours and mine
Boy maybe we could
bring it back
Maybe we could
bring it back
Maybe we could
bring it back to life
Maybe you could be mine

You're kissing me
And saying I'm
the one you need
keep you warm and
lay with you tonight
Baby I feel the same way
I don't want to leave
Wanna hold you close and
feel your love inside
But I don't wanna
play myself
Cause I know you're with
someone else
And I don't need
complications in my life
And I don't wanna
fall back in
And get caught up in
you again
Boy I'm so conflicted
in my mind
Oh you keep saying it
stay the night
Just let me
rock you till the
morning light
It's cold outside and
much too late to drive
You know I need you baby
I'm so lost
without your love
Obviously
procrastinating just to be
Close to you a
little longer now
It's hard for me
to break away from you baby
Never could resist you and I
still haven't learned how
And I don't wanna be a fool
But it's hard when it
comes to you
And I'm feeling vulnerable
tonight
Cause I don't wanna
miss the chance
Of reliving our
sweet romance
Boy I'm so confused down
deep inside
You keep saying it
stay the night
Just let me rock you til the
morning light
It's cold outside and
much too late to drive
You know I need you baby
I'm so lost
without your love

Oh you keep saying it
stay the night
Just let me rock you til the
morning light
It's cold outside and
much too late to drive
You know I need you baby
I'm so lost
without your love
stay the night
stay the night
I'm so lost
without your love
stay the night
stay the night
stay the night
Ever since you left me
I've been trying to
hide the pain
Painting on a smile
with lipstick
Putting on a big charade
So difficult to
keep pretending
It's getting harder everyday
It's plain to see
I'm cold and heartsick
Since you turned and
walked away
I just keep going
round and round
And round in circles
Keep on tumbling down
Oh boy my world has changed
And I don't think
I can make it without you
Nothing's the same
You got me running around
in circles over you
Running around in
circles over you
Saturday I saw you
Holding hands with
someone new
Somehow I kept my composure
Just like everything
was cool
But inside I kept repeating
Don't you let
them see you cry
So I casually turned my head
As the tears rolled
down my eyes
I just keep going
round and round
And round in circles
Keep on tumbling down
Oh boy my world has changed
And I don't think
I can make it without you
Nothing's the same
You got me running around
in circles over you
Everything is you
How can I pull through
My heart is consumed
I'm so confused
Still caught up in you
Love can be so cruel
Baby don't know how to
turn you loose
Oh boy my world has changed
And I don't think
I can make it without you
No nothing's the same
You got me running around
And running around
And running around
Nothing's the same
Baby baby cause you
Got me running around
In circles over you
Running around in
circles over you
See, I used to be so shy
Sit at home and fantasize
(I should be your girl)
but I ain't wastin' no more time
cause I've got to make you mine
I'm gonna make you want to
Get with me tonight
I'm gonna put those naughty
Thoughts into your mind
I'm gonna show you clearly
I can rock your world
You're gonna know for sure
That I should be your girl
See I used to be afraid
But now baby I can't wait
I just gotta have your love
And enough's enough's enough
I'm gonna make you want to
Get with me tonight
I'm gonna put those naughty
Thoughts into your mind
I'm gonna show you clearly
I can rock your world
You're gonna know for sure
That I should be your girl

I'm gonna make you want to
Get with me tonight
I'm gonna put those naughty
Thoughts into your mind
I'm gonna show you clearly
I can rock your world
You're gonna know for sure
That I should be your girl
Somehow I know that
There's a place up above
With no more
hurt and struggling
Free of all atrocities
and suffering
Because I feel the
unconditional love
From one who cares
enough for me
To erase all my burdens
And let me be free to
Fly like a bird
Take to the sky
I need you now Lord
Carry me high
Don't let the world
break me tonight
I need the strength of
You by my side
Sometimes this life
can be so cold
I pray You'll come and
carry me home
Can we recover
Will the world ever be
A place of peace
and harmony
With no war and with
no brutality
If we loved each other
We would find victory
But in this harsh reality
Sometimes I'm so despondent
That I feel the need to
Fly like a bird
Take to the sky
I need You now Lord
Carry me high
Don't let the world
break me tonight
I need the strength of
You by my side
Sometimes this life
can be so cold
I pray You'll come and
carry me home

I need you now Lord
need you by my side
Keep your head to the sky
With God's love
you'll survive
Fly like a bird
Take to the sky
I need you now Lord
Carry me high
Don't let the world
break me tonight
I need the strength of
You by my side
Sometimes this life
can be so cold
I pray You'll come and
carry me home
Carry me higher
Fly like a bird
Take to the sky
I need you now Lord
Carry me higher
Don't let the world
break me tonight
I need the strength of
You by my side
Sometimes this life
can be so cold
I pray You'll come and
carry me home
carry me home
Carry me higher
higher higher
Carry me higher
higher higher
Carry me higher
higher higher
Carry me higher
higher higher
Carry me higher
higher higher
Carry me higher
higher higher
Carry me higher
Carry me higher
