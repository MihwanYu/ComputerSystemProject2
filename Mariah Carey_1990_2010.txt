No I can't forget this evening or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile, but in your eyes
Your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows
No I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know
I can't live 
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't give
I can't give anymore
Well, I can't forget this evening or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile, but in your eyes
Your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
No no no no I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
I can't live

Treated me kind Sweet destiny
Carried me through desperations
To the one that was waiting for me
It took so long Still I believed
Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given
to me Prayed through the nights
Felt so alone
Suffered from alienation
Carried the weight on my own
Had to be strong So I believed
And now I know I've succeeded
In fiding the place I conceived
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given
to me I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given
to me I've realized the dream
And I visualized the love that
came to be i'm so alive
I'm so thankful that I've received
The answer that heaven has sent
down to me treated me kind
Sweet destiny
And I'll be eternally grateful
Prayed through the nights
So faithfully faithfully
Knowing the one that I needed
Would find me eventually
I had a vision of love

I had a vision of love

that you turn out to be

It wasn't raining yet
But it was a little misty on
That warm November night
My heart was pounding
My inner voice resounding
Begging me to turn away
But I just had to see your face
To feel alive
And then you casually walked into the room
And I was twisted in the web
Of my desire for you
(And I was twisted)
My apprehension blew away
I only wanted you
To taste my sadness
As you kissed me in the dark

Everytime I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night

And so we finished the Moet and
started feeling liberated
And I surrendered as you took me
In your arms
I was so caught up in the moment
I couldn't bear to let you go yet
So I threw caution to the wind
And started listening to my longing heart
And then you softly pressed your lips to mine
And feelings surfaced I'd suppressed
For such a long time
(And I was lifted)
And for a while I forgot
The sorrow and the pain
And melted with you as we stood
There in the rain

Everytime I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
Everytime I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night

Last night I dreamed that I
Whispered the words I love you
And touched you so very
Subtly as we were kissing goodbye
(Pretty baby- How I'm missing you)

Everytime I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
(Envision you caressing me)
And go back in time
(I go back)
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
(On the roof that rainy night)

Everytime I feel the need
(When I feel the need)
I envision you caressing me
(I envision you over and over and over again)
And go back in time
(I go back)
To relieve the splendor of you and I
(It was oh so sweet you and I)
On the rooftop that rainy night
(On that rainy night)

Everytime I feel the need
(Last night I had the strangest dream...)
I envision you caressing me
(It actually quite symbolic)
And go back in time
(As I whispered...that I loved you)
To relieve the splendor of you and I
(...very subtly)

Everytime I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night

Sorry I never told you
All I wanted to say
And now it's
too late to hold you
'Cause you've flown away
So far away
Never had I imagined
Living without your smile
Feeling
and knowing you hear me
It keeps me alive
Alive
And I know you're shining down
on me from Heaven
Like so many friends
we've lost along the way
And I know eventually
we'll be together
One sweet day
Eventually
we'll sing in heaven
Darling I never showed you
Assumed you'd always be there
But I I took your presence
for granted
But I always cared
And I miss the love we shared
And I know you're shining down
on me from Heaven
Like so many friends
we've lost along the way
And I know eventually
we'll be together
One sweet day
Eventually
we'll sing in heaven
Although the sun will
never shine the same
I'll always
look to a brighter day
Lord I know
when I lay me down to sleep
You will always
listen as I pray
And I know you're shining
down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends
we've lost along the way
And I know eventually
we'll be together
One sweet day
And I know you're shining
down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends
we've lost along the way
And I know eventually
we'll be together
One sweet day
Eventually
we'll sing in heaven
Sorry I never told you
All I wanted to say

I won't
See your smile
And I won't hear you laugh anymore
Every night
I won't see you walk through that door
'Cause time wasn't on your side
It isn't right
I can't say I love you
It's too late to tell you
But I really need you to know, oh baby
No, I'll never forget you
I'll never let you out of my heart
You will always be here with me
I'll hold on to the memories baby
Baby, can you hear me
Wherever you may be tonight
Are you near me
I need you to be by my side
'Cause I never said goodbye
It isn't right
I should have said I love you
Why didn't I just tell you
God knows I need you to know, oh baby
No, I'll never forget you
I'll never let you out of my heart
You will always be here with me
I'll hold on to the memories baby
Somewhere
I know you'll be with me
Someday
In another time
But right now you're gone
You've just vanished away
But I'll never leave you behind
No, I'll never forget you
I'll never let you out of my heart
You will always be here with me
I'll hold on to the memories
You will always be dear to me baby
No, I'll never forget you
I'll never let you out of my heart
You will always be here with me
I'll hold on to the memories
No, I'll never forget you
I'll never let you out of my heart

I am thinking of you
In my sleepless solitude tonight
If it's wrong to love you
Then my heart just won't
let me be right
Cause I've drowned in you
And I won't pull through
Without you by my side
I'd give my all to have
just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
your body next to mine
Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory
of your song
I'd give my all for your
love tonight
Baby can you feel me
Imagining I'm looking
in your eyes
I can see you clearly
Vividly emblazoned in my mind
And yet you're just so far
like a distant star
I'm wishing on tonight
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
your body next to mine
Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory
of your song
I'd give my all for your
love tonight

I'd give my all to have
just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
your body next to mine
Cause I can't go on
living in the memory
of your song
I'd give my all for your
love tonight
Give my all for your
love tonight

When I am lost
You shine a light for me and set me free
When I am low
You wash away my tears
And take me through
The loneliness
And emptiness
Through the darkest night
Somehow I survive
Through it all
When you tell me I'm the only one you need
Sweet and tenderly
And your love
Breaks away the clouds surroundin' me
All I have I want to give to thee
If I should fall
Your love is strong enough to lift me up
If I'm afraid
You chase away my fears
And take me to
A brighter place
Beyond the rain
And I feel alright
Because you're by my side
Through it all
When you tell me I'm the only one you need
Sweet and tenderly
And your love
Breaks away the clouds surrounding me
All I have I want to give to thee
You take me through
The loneliness and the emptiness
And I feel alright
'Cause you're by my side
Through it all
You tell me I'm the only one you need
Sweet and tenderly
And your love
Just breaks away the clouds surrounding me
And baby all I have I want to give to thee
Want to give you all of my love
Now and forever my love
All I have I want to give to thee

There's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
It's a long road
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand
For you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself
And that emptiness you felt
Will disappear
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you, oh, oh
Lord knows
Dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone
Tear them away, hey yeah
Hold on
There will be tomorrow
In time you'll find the way
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you
Mmm, that a hero lies in you

It was twilight
On the Fourth of July
Sparkling colors were
Strewn across the sky
And we sat close enough
That we just barely touched
While roman candles
Went soaring above us and baby
Then you put your hand in mine
And we wandered away
I was trembling inside
But I wanted to stay
Pressed against you there
and leave the world behind
On that Fourth of July
So starry eyed
On the flowery hillside
Breathless and fervid
Amid the dandelions
As it swept over me
Like the wind trough the trees
I felt you sigh with a
Sweet intensity and baby
Then you put your hand in mine
And we floated away
Delicately lay entwined
In an intimate daze
A crescent moon began to shine
And I wanted to stay
Tangled up with you among
the fireflies
On that Fourth of July
Thunder clouds Hung around
So threateningly
Ominously hovering And the sky
Opened wide Showering
Then you put your hand in mine
And we ran from the rain
Tentatively kissed goodnight
And went our separate ways
And I've never truly felt
the way that I
Felt the Fourth of July
Truly I have never felt
the same inside
Like that Fourth of July
Truly I could never feel
the same as I
Felt that Fourth of July

Oh when you walk by every night

Talking sweet and looking fine

I get kind of hectic inside

Oh baby I'm so into you

Darling if you only knew

All the things that flow through my mind

But it's just a



Sweet sweet fantasy baby

When I close my eyes

You come and take me

On and on and on

It's so deep in my daydreams

But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby



Images of rapture

Creep into me slowly

As you're going to my head

And my heart beats faster

When you take me over

Time and time and time again

But it's just a



Sweet sweet fantasy baby

When I close my eyes

You come and take me

On and on and on

It's so deep in my daydreams

But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby



Sweet sweet fantasy baby

When I close my eyes

You come and take me

On and on and on

It's so deep in my daydreams

But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby



I'm in heaven

With my boyfriend

My laughing boyfriend

There's no beginning and there is no end

Feels like I'm dreaming but I'm not sleeping



It's just a

Sweet sweet fantasy baby

When I close my eyes

You come and take me

On and on and on

It's so deep in my daydreams

But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby



Sweet sweet fantasy baby

When I close my eyes

You come and take me

On and on and on

It's so deep in my daydreams

But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby



Sweet sweet fantasy baby

Sweet sweet fantasy baby

Baby don't tell me
You miss me
You love me
Don't whisper gently
That you can't forget me
Tonight tonight
Cause I've heard it all before
Just turn away
Don't play that game
Baby I don't want to anymore
Let it all
Fade away
Don't you know the love is gone
It's too late
Everything fades away
Nothing ever stays the same
Baby

You're sorry you hurt me
How many times can I give in
How many battles can you win
Oh don't beg for mercy
Tonight tonight
Cause I can't take anymore
Just turn around

Baby I don't love you like before
Let it all
Fade away
Don't you know the love is gone

Nothing ever stays the same
It's so hard for me
To let you go
Don't leave me standing in the cold
Oh baby give it one more change
I know that we can make it last
Just let me love you one more time
Cause I don't want to lose my mind
It's so hard for me to let you go
It's so hard for me to let you go
Let it all
Fade away
love is gone
It's too late
Everything fades away
Nothing ever stays the same
Nothing ever stays the same
Let it all
Fade away
love is gone
It's too late
Everything fades away

I just want someone to belong to everyday of my life
Always
So come and take me away
Dream lover come rescue me
Take me up take me down

I was wayward child
With the weight of the world
That I held deep inside
Life was a winding road
And I learned many things
Little ones shouldn't know
But I closed my eyes
Steadied my feet on the ground
Raised my head to the sky
And though time's rolled by
Still feel like that child
As I look at the moon
Maybe I grew up
A little too soon

Funny how one can learn
To grow numb to the madness
And block it away
I left the worst unsaid
Let it all dissipate
And I try to forget
But I closed my eyes
Steadied my feet on the ground
Raised my head to the sky
And though time's rolled by
Still feel like that child
As I look at the moon
Maybe I grew up
A little too soon

Nearing the edge
Obvious I almost
Fell right over
A part of me
Will never be quite able
To feel stable
That woman child falling inside
Was on the verge of fading
Thankfully I
Woke up in time

Guardian angel I
Sail away on an ocean
With you by my side
Orange clouds roll by
They burn into your image
And you're still alive
But I closed my eyes
Steadied my feet on the ground
Raise my head to the sky
And though time's rolls by
Still feel like that child
As I look at the moon
Maybe I grew up
A little too soon

When you love someone so deeply
They become your life
It's easy to succumb to over
whelming fears inside
Blindly I imagined I could
Keep your under glass
Now I understand to hold you
I must open up my hands
And watch you rise
Spread you wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly
I have learned that beauty
Has to flourish in the light
Wild horses run unbridled
Or their spirit dies
You have given me the courage
To be all that I can
And truly feel your heart
will lead you back to me when you're
when you're ready to land
Spread you wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly Butterfly
I can't pretend these tears
Aren't over flowing steadily
I can't prevent this hurt from
Almost overt aking me
But I will stand and say goodbye
stand say goodbye
For you'll never be mine
Until you know the way it
feels to fly
Spread you wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
I will know your mind
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly
Spread you wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly
So flutter through the sky
butterfly
fly
spread your wings and fly
Butterfly

[Layzie Bone]
Don't Breakdown yet it's over, over
Don't Breakdown yet it's over, over
Don't Breakdown yet it's over, over
Don't Breakdown yet it's over
[Krayzie Bone (1)]
(Mariah Carey humming in background)
Steady breaking me on down
Break breakdown
Steady breaking me on down
Break breakdown
Steady breaking me on down
[Mariah Carey]
You called yesterday
To basically say
That you care for me but
That you're just not in love
Immediately I pretended to be
Feeling similarly
In that you'd ever leave
I was ok to just walk away from the
One thing that's unyielding and sacred to me
[Chorus: sung by Mariah Carey; Krayzie Bone singing 1 in background]
Well I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm
Slowly losing my mind
Underneath the guise of smile
Gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel
And I lie convincingly
Cause I don't want to reveal
The fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise
Til I go home at night
And turn down all the lights
And then I breakdown and cry
[Mariah Carey]
So what do you do when
Somebody you're so devoted to
Suddenly just stops loving you
And it seems they haven't got a clue
Of the pain that rejection is putting you through
Do you cling to your pride
And sing 'I Will Survive'
(Krayzie Bone in background: Gotta get control and roll roll roll on)
Do you lash out and say
How dare you leave this way
Do you hold in vain
As they just slip away
[Chorus]
[Wish Bone]
Gonna break you down, down, down, only if you let it (Don't let it)
Everyday crazy situations rocking my mind trying to break me down
But I won't let it forget it
If you feel the same way that I do
Then let me hear y'all all sing too
Sing, it's al-right, it's alright, it's alright yeah
Hoping for the sun, but it looks like rain
B-O-N-E, but it's still the same
Came this far, but it's been a long road
Troubles gonna come but we gotta stay strong, hold on, on
[Krayzie Bone]
Aw, yeah, I often feel the pressures, y'all
But nevertheless Krayzie won't fall
It's over, it's ending here, here
I said it's over. It's ending here, here
So I'll be on my way
And maybe we can meet up in the future one day
But for now I'm bailing, bailing
Bailing!, baby gotta get up, can't take no more
I'm headed for the door
Come and take a look into this humble eye
Tell me if we lived a lie
Would I, should you now
[Layzie Bone]
Every new day is a test for me
So I just pray to the Lord for him to bless me, please
There's struggles I'm going through lately
Breaks me down, set me free
Let me be, let me be
Who else do we have to rely on
Whose shoulder can a thug go cry on
Can't forget my Bible
While you look into my eyes
Won't underestimate this soldier story
I'ma tell you right now I'ma stand up
Wrong if I let my lead bust
Pac said keep your head up
Don't let this world get the best of you
All my struggles, I'm through
If it's over, over, over
Don't breakdown yet it's over
[Chorus]
(with Mariah Carey singing in background)
[Chorus]
(With Mariah Carey singing and Krayzie Bone singing 1 all in background)
Cry, cry (Break break down)
Cry, cry (Steady breaking me on down)
Cry, cry (Break break down)
Cry, cry (Steady breaking me on down)

If you're lonely
And need a friend
And troubles seem like
They never end
Just remember to keep the faith
And love will be there to light the way
Anytime you need a friend
I will be here
You'll never be alone again
So don't you fear
Even if you're miles away
I'm by your side
So don't you ever be lonely
Love will make it alright
When the shadows are closing in
And your spirit diminishing
Just remember you're not alone
And love will be there
To guide you home
Anytime you need a friend
I will be here
You'll never be alone again
So don't you fear
Even if you're miles away
I'm by your side
So don't you ever be lonely
Love will make it alright
If you just believe in me
I will love you endlessly
Take my hand
Take me into your heart
I'll be there forever baby
I won't let go
I'll never let go
Anytime you need a friend
I will be here
You'll never be alone again
So don't you fear
Even if you're miles away
I'm by your side
So don't you ever be lonely
It's alright
It's alright, it's alright
Yes, you know it's alright
Oh, don't ever feel it
Oh, I'm by your side don't you ever be lonely
Yeah, anytime
Oh, you'll never be alone

It's 2 11 and I'm stressing
Watching Tv in my hotel suite
I check my service
every second
At 2 10 you still hadn't
called me
So I'm gonna leave
my cell phone turned on
in my purse by the bed
And before I fall asleep
I guess I'll just check
my machine
Again and again because I'm
Obsessing on you
I wanna be your babydoll
Wrap me up nice and tight
Love me through the night
Come lay me down
Enfold me in your arms
Cover me with velvet kisses
Rock me on and on
And whisper softly to me
You wanna be my babydoll
Zoning out thinking about
You and me between the sheets
I want to get intimate
But you're not within
my reach
So I'll have a
little more wine
And I'll try to drink you
Out of my head
And I'll lay awake awhile
'Til I'm high enough I can
Forget about you until
I wake up again
I wanna be your babydoll
Wrap me up nice and tight
Love me through the night
Come lay me down
Enfold me in your arms
Cover me with velvet kisses
Rock me on and on
And whisper softly to me
You wanna be my babydoll
Slipping into dreams
I feel my love surround you
my subconscious seems
To weave itself around you
Do you care for me
Beyond idolization
Tell me how you feel
But don't keep me at bay
Cause I won't be waiting long
I wanna be your babydoll
Wrap me up nice and tight
Love me through the night
Come lay me down
Enfold me in your arms
Cover me with velvet kisses
Rock me on and on
And whisper softly to me
You wanna be my babydoll
I wanna be your babydoll
Wrap me up nice and tight
Love me through the night
Come lay me down
Enfold me in your arms
Cover me with velvet kisses
Rock me on and on
And whisper softly to me
You wanna be my babydoll
my babydoll
Rock me on on and on

I wanna be your babydoll

I wanna be your babydoll

I wanna be your babydoll

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
Yeah
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need (and I)
Don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking there upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy with a toy on Christmas Day
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, baby
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow (and I)
I'm just gonna keep on waiting underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it to the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to hear those magic reindeer click
'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Oh, baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby
Oh-oh, all the lights are shining so brightly everywhere (so brightly, baby)
And the sound of children's laughter fills the air (oh, oh, yeah)
And everyone is singing (oh, yeah)
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? (Yeah, oh)
Won't you please bring my baby to me?
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just wanna see my baby standing right outside my door
Oh, I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Oh, baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas (all I really want) is you, baby
All I want (I want) for Christmas (all I really want) is you, baby
Treated me kind
Sweet destiny
Carried me through desperation
To the one that was waiting for me
It took so long
Still I believed
Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've
given to me

Prayed through the nights
Felt so alone
Suffered from alienation
Carried the weight on my own
Had to be strong
So I believed
And now I know I've succeeded
In finding the place I conceived
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've
given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given me
I've realized a dream
And I visualized
The love that came to be
Feel so alive
I'm so thankful that I've received
The answer that heaven
has sent down to me
You treated me kind
Sweet destiny
And I'll be eternally grateful
Holding you so close to me
Prayed through the nights
So faithfully
Knowing the one that I needed
Would find me eventually
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've
given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you
turned out to be
I had it all
But I let it slip away
Couldn't see I
treated you wrong
Now I wander around
Feeling down and cold
Trying to believe
that you're gone
Love takes time
To heal when you're
hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain Inside
'Cause love takes time
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here alone

Losing my mind
From this hollow in my heart
Suddenly I'm so incomplete
Lord I'm needing you now
Tell me how to stop the rain
Tears are falling down
endlessly
Love takes time
To heal when you're
hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain Inside
'Cause love takes time
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here alone
You might say
that it's over
You might say
that you don't care
You might say
you don't miss me
You don't need me
But I know that you do
And I feel that you do Inside
Love takes time
To heal when you're
hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain Inside
'Cause love takes time
I don't wanna be there
I don't wanna be there alone
You were so blind to let me go
You had it all but did not know
No one you'll ever find will be
Closer to all your dreams than me
Believing the grass would be greener
You told yourself
I just don't need her now
But I know you'll soon discover
You're never satisfied with any other
Someday Oo Someday
One you gave away will be the
only one you're wishing for
Someday, Someday hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay
cause baby I'm the one who's
keeping score
You'll change your mind and
call my name
As soon as you find they're
all the same
And when you find yourself alone
Don't come back crying
You should have known
Believe me I'm not pretending
It's not hard to predict
This ending now
'Cause I know you'll soon discover
You're needing me in spite of
all the others
Someday Oo Someday
One you gave away will be the
only one you're wishing for
Someday, Someday hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause baby
I'm the one who's keeping score
Someday Oo Someday
One you gave away will be the
only one you're wishing for
Someday, Someday hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause baby
I'm the one who's keeping score
Maybe now you just can't conceive
That there'll ever come a
time when you're cold and lonely
Baby, how could you ever believe
That another could replace me
The one and only
But when your down
In your time of need
And you're thinking that you
Might be coming back to own me
Just think again 'cause
I won't need your love anymore

Oo Someday
Someday Oo Someday
One you gave away will be
the only one you're wishing for
Someday, Someday hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause
baby I'm the one who's keeping score
Someday Oo Someday
One you gave away will be the
only one you're wishing for
Someday hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause
baby I'm the one who's keeping score
Someday Oo Someday
One you gave away will be the
only one you're wishing for
Someday hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay
cause baby I'm the one who's
keeping score
Once again we sit in silence
After all is said and done
Only emptiness inside us
Baby look what we've become
We can make a million promises
But we still won't change
It isn't right to stay together
When you only bring each other pain
I don't wanna cry Don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world
Could take us back
To where we used to be
Though I've given you
my heart and soul
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry

Too far apart to bridge the distance
But something keeps us
hanging on and on Pretending
not to know the difference
Denying what we had is gone
Every moment we're together
It's just breaking me down
I know we swore it was forever
But it hurts too much to stay
around I don't wanna cry
Don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world
Could take us back
To where we used to be
Though I've given you
my heart and soul
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry

All the magic's gone
There's just a shadow of a memory
Something just went wrong
We can't go on make believing
on make believing
'Cause I don't wanna cry
Don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world
Could take us back
To where we used to be
Though I've given you
my heart and soul
I've given you my heart and soul
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby I don't wanna cry

I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever
dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above
I feel good I feel nice
I've never felt so
Satisfied
I'm in love I'm alive
Intoxicated
Flying high
It like a dream
When you touch me tenderly
I don't know it's real
But I like the way I feel
Inside
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever
dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above
In the morning
When I rise
You are the first thing
On my mind
And in the middle
Of the night
I feel your heartbeat
Next to mine
I it feels like a dream
When you love me tenderly
I don't know if you're for real
But I like the way I feel
Inside
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever
dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever
dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above
You know the way
to make me lose control
When you're looking
into my eyes
You make me feel so
High High High High High

You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever
dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above
Higher emotions
Deeper than I've ever
dreamed of
emotions
Higher emotions
Deeper than I've ever
dreamed of
You emotions
You've got than feeling
Higher
woo oh yeah

oh yeah

There you are holding her hand
I am lost Dying to understand
Didn't I cherish you right
Don't you know you were my life
Even though I try I can't let go
Something in your eyes
Captured my soul
And every night
I see you in my dreams
You're all I know
I can't let go
Just cast aside
You don't even know I'm alive
You just walk on by
Don't care to see me cry
And here I am
Still holding on
I can't accept my world is gone
no no
Even though I try I can't let go
Something in your eyes
Captured my soul
And every night
I see you in my dreams
You're all I know
I can't let go
Do you even realize the sorrow
sorrow I have inside
everyday of my life
Do you know the way it feels
When all you have just dies
I try and try to
deny that I need you
But still you remain on my mind
Even though I try I can't let go
Something in your eyes
Captured my soul
And every night
I see you in my dreams
You're all I know
I can't let go
Even though I try I can't let go
Something in your eyes
Captured my soul
And every night
I see you in my dreams
You're all I know
I can't let go
Not more than
three short years ago
I was abandoned and alone
Without a penny to my name
So very young and so afraid
No proper shoes upon my feet
Sometimes
I couldn't even eat
I often
cried myself to sleep
But I had to keep on going
Never knowing
If I could take it
If I would make it
through the night
I held on to my faith
I struggled and I prayed
And now I've found my way
If you believe in
yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
Make it happen
And if you get down on your
knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
Make it happen
He's gonna make it happen
I know life can be so tough
And you feel like giving up
But you must be strong
Baby just hold on
Never find the answers
If you throw your life away
I used to
feel the way you do
Still I had to keep on going
Never knowing
If I could take it
If I would make it
through the night
I held on to my faith
I struggled and I prayed
And now
I've finally found my way
If you believe in
yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
Make it happen
You're gonna make it happen
And if you get down on your
knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
Make it happen
If you believe in
yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
Make it happen
And if you get down on your
knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
Make it happen
Make it happen

Make it
He's gonna make it
Make it
Oh make it

I held on to my faith
I struggled and I prayed
And finally found my way
If you believe in
yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
Make it happen
And if you get down on your
knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
Make it happen
If you believe in
yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
Make it happen
And if you get down on your
knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
Make it happen
I once was lost
But now I'm found
I got my feet
On solid ground
Thank you Lord
If you believe
Within your soul
Just hold on tight
And don't let go
You can make it
Make it happen
through the make it
Make it happen
gonna make it
gonna make it
gonna make it
If you believe in
yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
Make it happen
And if you get down on your
knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
Make it happen
If you believe in
yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
Make it happen
And if you get down on your
knees at night
And pray to the Lord

You always smile but in your eyes
Your sorrow shows

When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there
But then I let you go

Oh when you walk by every night
Talking sweet and looking fine
I get kind of hectic inside
Oh baby I'm so into you
Darling if you only knew
All the things
flow through my mind
But it's just a
Sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I not close my eyes
You come and take me
On and on and on
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet sweet
fantasy baby

Images of rapture
Creep into me slowly
As you're going to my head
And my heart beats faster
When you take me over
Time and time and time again
But it's just a
Sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I not close my eyes
You come and take me
On and on and on
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet sweet
fantasy baby

Sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I not close my eyes
You come and take me
On and on and on
It's so deep in my day dreams
But it's just a sweet sweet
fantasy baby
I'm in heaven
With my boyfriend
My laughing boyfriend
There's no beginning and there
is no end
Feels like I'm dreaming but
I'm not sleeping
Sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I not close my eyes
You come and take me
On and on and on
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet sweet
fantasy baby
Sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I not close my eyes
You come and take me
On and on and on
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet sweet
fantasy baby
Sweet sweet fantasy baby
Sweet sweet fantasy baby
Sorry I never told you
All I wanted to say
And now it's
too late to hold you
'Cause you've flown away
So far away
Never had I imagined
Living without your smile
Feeling
and knowing you hear me
It keeps me alive
Alive
And I know you're shining down
on me from Heaven
Like so many friends
we've lost along the way
And I know eventually
we'll be together
One sweet day
Eventually
we'll sing in heaven
Darling I never showed you
Assumed you'd always be there
But I I took your presence
for granted
But I always cared
And I miss the love we shared
And I know you're shining down
on me from Heaven
Like so many friends
we've lost along the way
And I know eventually
we'll be together
One sweet day
Eventually
we'll sing in heaven
Although the sun will
never shine the same
I'll always
look to a brighter day
Lord I know
when I lay me down to sleep
You will always
listen as I pray
And I know you're shining
down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends
we've lost along the way
And I know eventually
we'll be together
One sweet day
And I know you're shining
down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends
we've lost along the way
And I know eventually
we'll be together
One sweet day
Eventually
we'll sing in heaven
Sorry I never told you
All I wanted to say
We were as one babe
For a moment in time
And it seemed everlasting
That you would always be mine
Now you want to be free
So I'll let you fly
Cause I know in my heart babe
Our love will never die
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy don't you know
you can't escape me
Ooh darling cause
you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling
this strong
No way you're ever gonna
shake me
Oh darling cause
you'll always be my baby

I aint gonna cry no
And I won't beg you to stay
If you're determined to
leave boy
I will not stand in your way
But inevitably
you'll be back again
Cause you know
in your heart babe
Our love will never end
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy don't you know
you can't escape me
Ooh darling cause
you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling
this strong
No way you're ever gonna
shake me
Oh darling cause
you'll always be my baby
I know that
you'll be back boy
When your days and
your nights
get a little bit colder
I know that
you'll be right back
Oh baby believe me
it's only a matter of time
time
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy don't you know
you can't escape me
Ooh darling cause
you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling
this strong
No way you're ever gonna
shake me
Oh darling cause
you'll always be my baby
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy don't you know
you can't escape me
Ooh darling cause
you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling
this strong
No way you're ever gonna
shake me
Oh darling cause
you'll always be my baby
I didn't mean it
When I said
I didn't love you so
I should have held on tight
I never should let you go
I didn't know nothing
I was stupid
I was foolish
I was lying to myself
I could't fathom that
I would ever
Be without your love
Never imagined I'd be
Sitting here beside myself
Cause I didn't know you
Cause I didn't know me
But I thought
I knew everything
I never felt
The feeling that I'm feeling
Now that
I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch
and kiss your lips
Cause I don't have a choice
Oh what I wouldn't give
To have you lying by my side
Right here cause baby
When you left
I lost a part of me
It's still
so hard to believe
Come back baby please
Cause we belong together
Who else am I
gon' lean on
When times get rough
Who's gonna talk to me
on the phone
Till the sun comes up
Who's gonna take your place
There ain't nobody better
Oh baby baby
We belong together
I can't sleep at night
When you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Saying to me
If you think
you're lonely now
Wait a minute
This is too deep
too deep
I gotta change the station
So turn the dial
Trying to catch a break
And then I hear Baby face
I only think of you
And it's breaking my heart
I'm trying to keep
it together
But I'm falling apart
I'm feeling all out
of my element
I'm throwing things
crying
Trying to figure out
Where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected
in this song
It ain't even half of what
I'm feeling inside
I need you
Need you back in my life
baby
When you left I lost
a part of me
It's still
so hard to believe
Come back baby please
Cause we belong together
Who else am I
gon' lean on
When times get rough
Who's gonna talk to me
on the phone
Till the sun comes up
Who's gonna take your place
There ain't nobody better
Oh baby baby
We belong together baby
When you left
I lost a part of me
It's still
so hard to believe
Come back baby
please
Cause we belong together
Who am I gonna lean on
When times get rough
Who's gonna talk to me
Till the sun comes up
Who's gonna take your place
There ain't nobody better
Oh baby
baby
We belong together
I gotta shake you off
Cause the
loving ain't the same
And you keep on
playing games
Like you know
I'm here to stay
I gotta shake shake you off
Just like the Calgon
commercial that
really gotta get
up outta here
And go somewhere
I gotta shake you off
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates
all the love I give
I gotta shake shake you off
Gotta do what's best for me
Baby and that means I gotta
Shake you off
By the time you get
this message
It's gonna be too late
So don't bother paging me
Cause I'll be on my way
See I grabbed
all my diamonds and clothes
Just ask your
momma she knows
You're gonna miss me baby
Hate to say I told you so
Well at first I didn't know
But now it's clear to me
You would cheat with all
your freaks and lie
compulsively
So I packed up my
Louis Vuitton
Jumped in your
ride and took off
You'll never ever
find a girl
Who loves you more than me
I gotta shake you off
Cause the
loving ain't the same
And you keep on
playing games
Like you
know I'm here to stay
I gotta shake shake you off
Just like the Calgon
commercial that
really gotta get
up outta here
And go somewhere
I gotta shake you off
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates
all the love I give

Gotta do what's best for me
Baby and that means I gotta
Shake you off
I gotta shake shake

I found out about a gang
Of your dirty little deeds
With this one and that one
By the pool
on the beach
in the streets
Heard y'all was
Hold up
my phone's breaking up
I'm a hang up
and call the
machine right back
I gotta
get this off of my mind
You wasn't worth my time
So leaving you behind
Cause I need a
real love in my life
Save this recording because
I'm never coming back home
Baby I'm gone
Don't cha know I gotta
I gotta shake you off
Cause the
loving ain't the same
And you keep on
playing games
Like you know
I'm here to stay

Baby and that means I gotta
Shake you off
I gotta shake you off
I gotta shak shake you off
I remember when you
used to be mine
Way back when
I was too naive to
love you right
But now if I only had
the opportunity
I would do anything
Because my heart
still believes
Maybe you could be
mine again
Maybe we could make
that dream for real
Like way back then
When love was
yours and mine
Maybe we could bring it
back to life

It's irrelevant to dwell
on the past
I'm accountable for
what went bad
And I mean that
But I keep on praying
for another chance
Just to have you back
Cause I've grown
And I know how to be
your everything
Maybe you could be
mine again
Maybe we could make
that dream for real
Like way back then
When love was
yours and mine
Maybe we could bring it
back to life
No no it ain't over yet
I just can't accept
the possibility
We weren't made for
each other's arms
I know you're my destiny
We can't erase
what was meant to be
Part of you and part of me
If we try one more time
Maybe somehow we'll survive
Maybe you could be
mine again
Maybe we could make
that dream for real
Like way back then
When love was
yours and mine
Boy maybe we could
bring it back
Maybe we could
bring it back
Maybe we could
bring it back to life
Maybe you could be mine

You're kissing me
And saying I'm
the one you need

lay with you tonight
Baby I feel the same way
I don't want to leave
Wanna hold you close and
feel your love inside
But I don't wanna
play myself
Cause I know you're with
someone else
And I don't need
complications in my life
And I don't wanna
fall back in
And get caught up in
you again
Boy I'm so conflicted
in my mind
Oh you keep saying it
stay the night
Just let me
rock you till the
morning light
It's cold outside and
much too late to drive
You know I need you baby
I'm so lost
without your love
Obviously
procrastinating just to be
Close to you a
little longer now
It's hard for me
to break away from you baby
Never could resist you and I
still haven't learned how
And I don't wanna be a fool
But it's hard when it
comes to you
And I'm feeling vulnerable
tonight
Cause I don't wanna
miss the chance
Of reliving our
sweet romance
Boy I'm so confused down
deep inside
You keep saying it
stay the night
Just let me rock you til the
morning light
It's cold outside and
much too late to drive
You know I need you baby
I'm so lost
without your love

Oh you keep saying it
stay the night
Just let me rock you til the
morning light
It's cold outside and
much too late to drive
You know I need you baby
I'm so lost
without your love
stay the night
stay the night
I'm so lost
without your love
stay the night
stay the night
stay the night
Ever since you left me
I've been trying to
hide the pain
Painting on a smile
with lipstick
Putting on a big charade
So difficult to
keep pretending
It's getting harder everyday
It's plain to see
I'm cold and heartsick
Since you turned and
walked away
I just keep going
round and round
And round in circles
Keep on tumbling down
Oh boy my world has changed
And I don't think
I can make it without you
Nothing's the same
You got me running around
in circles over you
Running around in
circles over you
Saturday I saw you
Holding hands with
someone new
Somehow I kept my composure
Just like everything
was cool
But inside I kept repeating
Don't you let
them see you cry
So I casually turned my head
As the tears rolled
down my eyes
I just keep going
round and round
And round in circles
Keep on tumbling down
Oh boy my world has changed
And I don't think
I can make it without you
Nothing's the same
You got me running around
in circles over you
Everything is you
How can I pull through
My heart is consumed
I'm so confused
Still caught up in you
Love can be so cruel
Baby don't know how to
turn you loose
Oh boy my world has changed
And I don't think
I can make it without you
No nothing's the same
You got me running around
And running around
And running around
Nothing's the same
Baby baby cause you
Got me running around
In circles over you
Running around in
circles over you
See, I used to be so shy
Sit at home and fantasize
(I should be your girl)
but I ain't wastin' no more time
cause I've got to make you mine
I'm gonna make you want to
Get with me tonight
I'm gonna put those naughty
Thoughts into your mind
I'm gonna show you clearly
I can rock your world
You're gonna know for sure
That I should be your girl
See I used to be afraid
But now baby I can't wait
I just gotta have your love
And enough's enough's enough
I'm gonna make you want to
Get with me tonight
I'm gonna put those naughty
Thoughts into your mind
I'm gonna show you clearly
I can rock your world
You're gonna know for sure
That I should be your girl

I'm gonna make you want to
Get with me tonight
I'm gonna put those naughty
Thoughts into your mind
I'm gonna show you clearly
I can rock your world
You're gonna know for sure
That I should be your girl
Somehow I know that
There's a place up above
With no more
hurt and struggling
Free of all atrocities
and suffering
Because I feel the
unconditional love
From one who cares
enough for me
To erase all my burdens
And let me be free to
Fly like a bird
Take to the sky
I need you now Lord
Carry me high
Don't let the world
break me tonight
I need the strength of
You by my side
Sometimes this life
can be so cold
I pray You'll come and
carry me home
Can we recover
Will the world ever be
A place of peace
and harmony
With no war and with
no brutality
If we loved each other
We would find victory
But in this harsh reality
Sometimes I'm so despondent
That I feel the need to
Fly like a bird
Take to the sky
I need You now Lord
Carry me high
Don't let the world
break me tonight
I need the strength of
You by my side
Sometimes this life
can be so cold
I pray You'll come and
carry me home

I need you now Lord
need you by my side
Keep your head to the sky
With God's love
you'll survive
Fly like a bird
Take to the sky
I need you now Lord
Carry me high
Don't let the world
break me tonight
I need the strength of
You by my side
Sometimes this life
can be so cold
I pray You'll come and
carry me home
Carry me higher
Fly like a bird
Take to the sky
I need you now Lord
Carry me higher
Don't let the world
break me tonight
I need the strength of
You by my side
Sometimes this life
can be so cold
I pray You'll come and
carry me home
carry me home
Carry me higher
higher higher
Carry me higher
higher higher
Carry me higher
higher higher
Carry me higher
higher higher
Carry me higher
higher higher
Carry me higher
higher higher
Carry me higher
Carry me higher
