Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)

(Christmas)
The snow's coming down
(Christmas)
I'm watching it fall
(Christmas)
Lots of people around
(Christmas)
Baby please come home
(Christmas)
The church bells in town
(Christmas)
All ringing in song
(Christmas)
Full of happy sounds
(Christmas)
Baby please come home
They're singing ＂Deck The Halls＂
But it's not like Christmas at all
Cuz I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year
(Christmas)
Pretty lights on the tree
(Christmas)
I'm watching them shine
(Christmas)
You should be here with me
(Christmas)
Baby please come home

They're singing ＂Deck The Halls＂
But it's not like Christmas at all
Cuz I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year
(Christmas)
If there was a way
(Christmas)
I'd hold back this tear
(Christmas)
But it's Christmas day
(Please) Please
(Please) Please
(Please) Please
(Please) Please
Baby please come home
(Christmas)
Baby please come home
(Christmas)
Baby please come home
(Christmas)
(Christmas)
(Christmas)

Peace, peace
Sleep, sleep,

All I Want for Christmas Is You

I don't want a lot for Christmas 
Theres just one thing I need 
I don't care about presents 
Underneath the Christmas tree 

I just want you for my own 
More than you could ever know 
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, yeah

I don't want a lot for Christmas 
There is just one thing I need 
I don't care about presents 
Underneath the Christmas tree 

I don't need to hang my stocking 
There upon the fire place 
Santa Claus wont make me happy 
With a toy on Christmas day 

I just want you for my own 
More than you could ever know 
Make my wish come true 
All I want for Christmas is you
You baby 

I won't ask for much this Christmas 
I won't even wish for snow 
I'm just gonna keep on waiting 
Underneath the mistletoe 

I won't make a list and send it 
To the North Pole for Saint Nick 
I won't even stay awake to 
Hear those magic reindeer click 

Cause I just want you here tonight 
Holding on to me so tight 
What more can I do 
Baby all I want for Christmas is you 
You Baby 

All the lights are shining 
So brightly everywhere 
And the sound of childrens 
Laughter fills the air 

And everyone is singing 
I hear those sleigh bells ringing 
Santa won't you bring me 
The one I really need 
Won't you please bring my baby to me 

Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas 
This is all I'm asking for 
I just want to see my baby 
Standing right outside my door 

Oh I just want him for my own 
More than you could ever know 
Make my wish come true 
Baby all I want for Christmas is you
You baby 

All I want for Christmas is you baby 
All I want for Christmas is you baby
All I want for Christmas is you baby


O Holy Night

O holy night the stars are
brightly shining
It is the night of our dear
Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin
and error pining
Till He appeared
and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope
the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks
a new glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angels' voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine, O night O night divine
A thrill of hope
the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks
a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angels' voices
O night divine O night
when Christ was born
O night divine, O night O night divine


Miss You Most (At Christmas Time)

The fire is burning
The room`s all aglow
Outside the December wind blows
Away in the distance the carolers
sing in the snow
Everybody`s laughing
The world is celebrating
And everyone`s so happy
Except for me tonight
Because I miss you
Most at Christmas time
And I can`t get you
Get you off my mind
Every other season comes along
And I`m all right
But then I miss you
most at Christmas time

I gaze out the window
This cold winter`s night
At all of the twinkling lights
Alone in the darkness
Remembering when you were mine
Everybody`s smiling
The whole world is rejoicing
And everyone`s embracing
Except for you and I
Baby I miss you
Most at Christmas time
And I can`t get you
Get you off my mind
Every other season comes along
And I`m all right
But then I miss you
most at Christmas time
In the springtime
those memories start to fade
With the April rain
Through the summer days
Till autumn`s leaves are gone
I get by without you
Till the snow begins to fall
And then I miss you
Most at Christmas time
And I can`t get you
Get you off my mind
Every other season comes along
And I`m all right...
But then I miss you
most at Christmas time

The whole world feels 
a little bit more love
When Christmas comes

And everywhere that you go
People singing 'Let It Snow'
And hanging up that mistletoe
And me and you gonna have

And we gon' kiss our worries 
and our cares away

Better than ever
And baby you're the one
Special treasure
I can't wait to unwrap your love
Until Christmas comes

But baby if you spread love
Someday it might be enough 
to heal each other one by one
And we gon' get together
And rejoice and pray
And we gon' help the world, 
become a better place
And we gon' sing and shout
Because the savior reigns
So don't dismay
Because this Christmas time
Get together
It's gonna be so nice
Better than ever
Because this gift of love lasts forever
The Lord makes our hearts open up
Soon as Christmas comes
It's gon' be alright

And we gon' laugh together

The Star

One dark night
Something said, ＂Follow the light＂
So you look up and see the word
That's written upon the sky
Strong and wise
Keeping the Lord as your guide
And through the doubt, you realize
He's with you all the while

Follow that star above you
Should the world try to break you down
There is one who waits for you
Though you can't see him now
Thunder and rain surrounds you
But His love's just a breath away
If you follow your heart, follow the light
Follow that... star

Follow your heart, it's Christmas
Follow your heart, it's Christmas

Shining bright
The spirit of love at first sight
And when the door won't welcome you
Heaven will help you inside
Gathered 'round
Bearing the gifts to the crown
A miracle comes, the babe is born
And angels are heard on high

Follow that star above you
Should the world try to break you down
There is one who waits for you
Though you can't see him now
Thunder and rain surrounds you
But His love's just a breath away
If you follow your heart, follow the light
Follow that... star

Follow your heart, it's Christmas
Follow your heart, it's Christmas

Follow that voice you heard
that no one else believed
Follow the dream that brought the King
on Christmas Eve, oh

Follow that star above you
Should the world try to break you down
There is one who waits for you
Though you can't see him now
Thunder and rain surrounds you
But His love's just a breath away
If you follow the voice, follow the song
Follow the word that makes you strong
Follow your heart, follow the light
Follow that... star

Follow your heart, it's Christmas
Follow your heart, it's Christmas
Follow your heart, it's Christmas
Follow your heart, it's Christmas
Follow your heart, it's Christmas
Follow your heart, it's Christmas
Follow your heart, it's Christmas


Oh Santa! (Feat. Ariana Grande & Jennifer Hudson)

Oh, Santa's gonna come
and make him mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come
and make him mine, mine
Oh Santa
Santa's gonna come
and make him mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come
and make him mine, mine
Oh Santa

Santa
If you get this letter
Won't you help me out?
I know you're kinda busy
with your elves right now
And I don't know how
You do the things you do
while I sleep on Christmas eve
But it's amazing
And I bet that you could
bring me back my baby
Because every time
I see Christmas lights
I feel this burn inside
And I just can't take it

I saw them shopping last week
And his new girl was so bleak
And then I swore to myself
Santa's gonna come and make
him mine this Christmas night

Ho, ho, ho
Santa's gonna come
and make you mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come
and make you mine, ho, ho, ho
Santa's gonna come
and make you mine this Christmas night

Oh Santa
I heard that it's really
gonna snow this year
So I hope Rudolph and
them other eight reindeer
Get you safely here
So you can scoop him up and
swoop him right down my chimney
I've been really, really,
really good this year
So put on that red suit
and make him appear
'Cause Christmas cheer
Just ain't the same without my baby
Come on, oh Kris Kringle,
send me help

They say it's unrealistic
But I believe in you Saint Nick
So grant this wish for me right quick
Santa won't you come and make
him mine this Christmas night?

Ho, ho, ho
Santa's gonna come and
make you mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and
make you mine, ho, ho, ho
Santa's gonna come
and make you mine this Christmas night

Oh, Santa
Oh, Santa
Oh, Santa
Come on, Santa

Oh Santa
Santa gon' come
and make him mine this Christmas
Santa gon' come
and make him mine, mine
Oh Santa
Santa gon' come
and make him mine this Christmas
Santa gon' come
and make him mine, mine

Oh, Santa Claus
If you get this letter,
please don't make me wait
‘Cause all December
I'll be counting down the days
So hop on your sleigh
I promise that I won't forget
the milk and cookies

The trees all sparkly and gold
But inside I feel so cold
So soon as you leave the North Pole
Santa won't you come
and make him mine this Christmas?

Santa's gonna come
and make you mine, ho, ho, ho
Santa's gonna come
and make you mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come
and make you mine, ho, ho, ho
Santa's gonna come
and make you mine, mine
Santa's gonna come
and make you mine, ho, ho, ho
Santa's gonna come
and make you mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come
and make you mine, ho, ho, ho
Santa's gonna come
and make you mine, mine
Santa's gonna come
and make you mine, ho, ho, ho
Santa's gonna come
and make you mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come
and make you mine, ho, ho, ho
Santa's gonna come
and make you mine, mine
Santa gon' come
and make you mine this Christmas
Santa gon' come and make you


Vision Of Love

Treated me kind
Sweet destiny
Carried me through desperation
To the one that was waiting for me
It took so long
Still I believed
Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

I had a vision of love
And it was all that youve given to me

Prayed through the nights
Felt so alone
Suffered from alienation
Carried the weight on my own

Had to be strong
So I believed
And now I know Ive succeeded
In finding the place I conceived

I had a vision of love (ooooh)
And it was all that youve given to me
I had a vision of love (ooooh)
And it was all that youve given me

Ive realized the dream
And I visualized
The love that came to be
Feel so alive
Im so thankful that I perceived
The answer that heaven has sent down to me

You treated me kind (yeah)
Sweet destiny (all that you did)
And Ill be eternally grateful
Holding you so close to me
Prayed through the nights 
So faithfully
Knowing the one that I needed
Would find me eventually (would find me)

I had a vision of love
And it was all that youve given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you turned out to be


Emotions

You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

I feel good
I feel nice
I've never felt so
Satisfied
I'm in love
I'm alive
Intoxicated
Flying high
It feels like a dream
When you touch me tenderly
I don't know if it's real
But I like the way I feel
Inside

You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

In the morning
When I rise
You are the first thing
On my mind
And in the middle
Of the night
I feel your heartbeat
Next to mine
If feels like a dream
When you love me tenderly
I don't know if you're for real
But I like the way I feel
Inside

You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

You know the way to 
make me lose control
When you're looking 
into my eyes
You make me feel so
High

You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

Hero

There's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

It's a long road
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand
For you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself
And the emptiness you felt
Will disappear

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

Lord knows
Dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone
Tear them away
Hold on
There will be tomorrow
In time
You'll find the way

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you


Without You

No I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way
The story goes
You always smile but in your eyes
Your sorrow shows
Yes it shows
No I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there
But then I let you go
And now it's only fair
That I should let you know
What you should know

I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't give
I can't give anymore

Well I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way
The story goes
You always smile but in your eyes
Your sorrow shows
Yes it shows
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't give
I can't give anymore


Endless Love

My love

`Cause I know in my heart babe
Our love will never die, no

You`ll always be a part of me
I`m part of you indefinitely
Boy don`t you know you can`t escape me
Ooh darling `cause you`ll always be my baby

And we`ll linger on and on
Time can`t erase a feeling this strong
No way you`re never gonna shake me
Ooh darling `cause you`ll always be my baby

Do do doop
Do do doop do doop da dum
Do do doop dum
Do do doop do doop da dum

I ain`t gonna cry no
And I won`t beg you to stay
If you`re determined to leave boy
I will not stand in your way

But inevitably you`ll be back again
`Cause you know in your heart babe
Our love will never end, no

You`ll always be a part of me
I`m part of you indefinitely
Boy don`t you know you can`t escape me
Ooh darling `cause you`ll always be my baby

And we`ll linger on and on
Time can`t erase a feeling this strong
No way you`re never gonna shake me
Ooh darling `cause you`ll always be my baby

(I know that you`ll be back boy)
When your days and your nights get a little bit colder
(I know that) You`ll be right back, baby
Well, baby believe me it`s only a matter of time, time

You`ll always be a part of me
And I`m part of you indefinitely
Boy don`t you know you can`t escape me
Ooh darling `cause you`ll always be my baby

And we`ll linger on and on
(And we`ll linger on and on)
Time can`t erase a feeling this strong
No way you`re never gonna shake me (ooh baby)
Ooh darling `cause you`ll always be my baby

You`ll always be a part of me
And I`m part of you indefinitely
Boy don`t you know you can`t escape me

Honey

Honey, You can have me when you want me
If you just simply ask me to be there
And youre the only one who makes me come running
Cause what you got is far beyond compare

And its just like honey
When your love comes over me
Oh baby, Ive got a dependancy
Always strung out for another taste of your honey

Its like honey really washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And Im dyin for ya, cryin for ya, I adore ya
One hit of your love addicted me
Now Im strung out on you darlin
Dont you see every night and day
I cant hardly wait for another taste of honey

Honey I cant describe
How good it feels inside
Honey I cant describe
How good it feels inside

I cant be elusive with you Honey
Cause Its blatant that Ive feeling you
And its too hard for me to leave abruptly
Cause youre the only thing I wanna do

And its just like Honey
When your love comes over me
Oh baby, Ive got a dependancy
Always strung out for another
Taste of your honey

Its like honey really washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And Im dyin for ya, cryin for ya, I adore ya
One hit of your love addicted me
Now Im strung out on you darlin
Dont you see every night and day
I cant hardly wait for another taste of honey

Honey I cant describe
How good it feels inside
Honey I cant describe
How good it feels inside


My All

I am thinking of you
 In my sleepless solitude tonight
 If its wrong to love you
 Then my heart just wont let me be right
 Cause Ive drowned in you
 And I wont pull through
 Without you by my side

 Id give my all to have
 Just one more night with you
 Id risk my life to feel
 Your body next to mine
 Cause I cant go on
 Living in the memory of our song
 Id give my all for your love tonight

 Baby can you feel me
 Imagining Im looking in your eyes
 I can see you clearly
 Vividly emblazoned in my mind
 And yet youre so far
 Like a distant star
 Im wishing on tonight

 Give my all for your love
 Tonight


Against All Odds (Take A Look At Me Now) (Feat. Westlife)

How can I just let you walk away
Just let you leave without a trace
When I stand here
Taking every breath with you
Youre the only one
Who really knew me at all

How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave
Cause we shared
The laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears
Youre the only one
Who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
Theres just an empty space
Theres nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face

Take a good look at me now
Theres just an empty space
And you coming back to me
Is against all the odds
And thats what I got to take

I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
Theres so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why
Youre the only one
Who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
Theres just an empty space
Theres nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face 

Take a good look at me now
Theres just an empty space
But to wait for you is all I can do
And thats what Ive got to face

Take a good look at me now
Cause Ill still be standing there
And you coming back to me
Is against all the odds
And thats what I got to take

Take a good look at me now


Infinity

Why you mad? Talkin' 
'bout you're mad
Could it be that you 
just lost the best 
you've ever had?
That’s your bag, 
yup, that’s too bad
Show is over, 
you ain’t gotta act
Name hold weight 
like kilos
Boy, you actin' 
so corny like Fritos
Wouldn’t have none 
of that without me though
Ain’t none of my business, 
it's tea though
Outta ammo, gotta reload
If life was a game, 
you're a free throw
It's nothing that you 
don’t already know

Close the door, lose the key
Leave my heart on the mat for me
I was yours eternally
There’s an end to infinity
To infinity

How I say this? Fact 
that you still exist
No disrespect, 
no second thought 
it truly, truly is
Truthfully I’m through with this
Why are we still doing this?
Answer the phone 
like, "Who is this?"
Take your head and 
knock some sense
Je ne comprends pas
Ain’t no compliments (duh)
Ain’t no being friends (duh)
Ain’t no false pretense (duh)
Ain’t no make amends (duh)
Ain’t no come agains (duh)
That’s the story, 
ain’t no happy ends

Close the door, lose the key
Leave my heart on the mat for me
I was yours eternally
There’s an end to infinity
To infinity

Is it lack of 
ice got you so cold?
Have you ever felt 
this on your own?
Why you tryin' to play 
like you’re so grown?
Everything you own, 
boy, you still owe

Close the door, lose the key
Leave my heart on the mat for me
I was yours eternally
There’s an end to infinity
To infinity

You're leaving, 
you're leaving, you're out the door
Infinity loving
me more and more
You're leaving, 
you're leaving,
you're out the door
Infinity loving 
me more and more
Cause I believe infinity 
is more than just a made up dream
I believe infinity is 
more than just a made up dream


One Sweet Day (Feat. Boyz II Men)

Sorry, I`ve never told you, all I wanted to say
And now it`s too late to hold you
Cause you`ve flown away, so far away
 
Never had I imagined, living without your smile
Feeling and knowing you, hear me
It keeps me alive, alive
 
And I know you`re shining down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends we`ve lost along the way
And I know eventually we`ll be together
One sweet day, eventually I`ll see you in Heaven
 
Darling, I never showed you
Assumed you`d always be there
I, I took your presence for granted
But I always cared, and I miss the love we shared
 
And I know you`re shining down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends we`ve lost along the way
And I know eventually we`ll be together
One sweet day, picture a little scene from Heaven
 
Although, the sun will never shine the same
I`ll always look to a brighter day
Yeah, Lord I know, when I lay me down to sleep
You will always listen as I pray
 
And I know you`re shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we`ve lost along the way
And I know eventually we`ll be together
One sweet day
 
And I know you`re shining down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends we`ve lost along the way
And I know eventually we`ll be together
One sweet day
 
Sorry, I never told you, all I wanted to say.


Underneath The Stars

One summer night
We ran away for a while
Laughing, we hurried beneath the sky
To an obscure place to hide
That no-one could find

And we drifted to another state of mind
And imagined I was yours and you were mine
As we lay upon the grass
There in the dark
Underneath the stars
(Young love)
Underneath the stars

Weak in the knees
Wrapped in the warm gentle breeze
So shy, a bundle of butterflies
Flush with heat of desire
On a natural high

As we drifted to another place in time
And the feeling was so heady and sublime
As I lost my heart to you
There in the dark
Underneath the stars
(Young love)

Beautiful and bittersweetly
You were fading into me
And I was gently fading into you
But the time went sailing by
Reluctantly we said goodbye
And left our secret place so far behind
And I lay in bed all night
And I was drifting
Drifting
Drifting
Drifting

And I was yours
And you were my own
My own baby
As we lay
As we
Lay underneath the stars
(Young love)


Open Arms

Lying beside you here in the dark 
Feeling your heart beat with mine 
Softly you whisper 
You're so sincere 
How could our love be so blind 

We sailed on together 
We drifted apart 
And here you are by my side 

So now I come to you with open arms 
Nothing to hide 
Believe what I say 
So here I am with open arms 
Hoping you'll see what your love means to me 
Open arms 

Living without you 
Living alone 
This empty house seems so cold 
Wanting to hold you 
Wanting you near 
How much I wanted you home 

But now that you've come back 
Turned night into day 
I need you to stay 

So now I come to you with open arms 
Nothing to hide 
Believe what I say 
So here I am with open arms 
Hoping you'll see what your love means to me 
Open arms 
Arms Arms


When I Saw You

Soft heavenly eyes gazed into me 
Transcending space and time 
And I was rendered still 
There were no words for me to find at all 
As I stood there beside myself 
I could see you and no-one else 

When I saw you 
When I saw you 
I could not breathe 
I fell so deep 
When I saw you 
When I saw you 
I'd never be 
I'd never be the same 

Only once in a lifetime love rushes in 
Changing you with the tide 
And dawn's ribbon of light 
Bursts through the dark 
Wakening you inside 
And I thought it was all untrue 
Until there, all at once, I knew 

When I saw you 
When I saw you 
I could not breathe 
I fell so deep 
When I saw you 
When I saw you 
I'd never be 
I'd never be the same 

With no beginning 
And without an end 
You are the one for me 
And it's evident 
And your eyes told me so 
Your eyes let me know 

When I saw you 
When I saw you 
I could not breathe 
I fell so deep 
When I saw you 
When I saw you 
I'd never be 
I'd never be the same


Long Ago

Once upon a time 
You whispered softly in my ear 
Loving words and fairytales 
That I longed to hear 
I gave you my body and soul 
And you took control 
As you slowly swept me up 
And carried me away 
You told me pretty lies 
As I held onto you tight 
You knew how to get your way 
Ignorance was bliss in your warm embrace 

Long ago 
You used to want me 
Now its all so far away 
But you still haunt me 
And take me back to yesterday 

Every now and then 
I drown in thoughts of yesterday 
And the fools paradise that you blew away 
I feel you beside me again 
And remember when you came to my window 
On a dark and stormy day 
Baby, I need you now 
Tonight Im crumbling down 
Sinking in the memories 
Shadows of you keep washing over me 

Long ago 
You used to want me 
Now its all so far away 
But you still haunt me 

Long ago 
You used to want me 
Now its all so far away 
But you still haunt me 
And take me back to yesterday 

(So long ago) 
(So long ago) 
(So long ago) 
(So long ago) 
(So long ago) 
(So long ago) 
(So long ago) 
(So long ago) 

Baby, I need you now 
Cause tonight Im crumbling down 
Sinking in the memories 
Shadows of you keep washing over me 

Long ago 
You used to want me 
Now its all so far away 
But you still haunt me 
And take me back to yesterday 

Long ago 
You used to want me 
Now its all so far away 
But you still haunt me 

Long ago 
You used to want me 
Now its all so far away 
But you still haunt me


Melt Away

You come to me with a casual flow 
And suddenly, my defences start to go 
When you talk to me in that sensual tone 
It envelops me and I lose my self control 

And baby, I just melt away 
Fall like rain 
Everytime I see your face, I go off 
I just want to break it down 
Anytime you come around 
Maybe I could melt away in your arms 

Imagining that your taking it slow 
And so tenderly 
Till the feeling overflows 
When you look at me I go soft and cave in 
And I cant conceal that Im slowly weakening 

And baby, I just melt away 
Fall like rain 
Everytime I see your face, I go off 
I just want to break it down 
Anytime you come around 
Maybe I could melt away in your arms 

You and me in a cloud of reverie 
Spin around inside my head unendingly 
Thoughts run wild as I sit and rhapsodize 
Pretty pictures of what Id do if you were mine 

And baby, I just melt away 
Fall like rain 
Everytime I see your face, I go off 
I just want to break it down 
Anytime you come around 
Maybe I could melt away in your arms 

And baby, I just melt away 
Fall like rain 
Everytime I see your face, I go off 
I just want to break it down 
Anytime you come around 
Maybe I could melt away in your arms
