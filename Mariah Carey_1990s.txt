No I can't forget this evening or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile, but in your eyes
Your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows
No I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't give
I can't give anymore
Well, I can't forget this evening or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile, but in your eyes
Your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
No no no no I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
I can't live

Treated me kind Sweet destiny
Carried me through desperations
To the one that was waiting for me
It took so long Still I believed
Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given
to me Prayed through the nights
Felt so alone
Suffered from alienation
Carried the weight on my own
Had to be strong So I believed
And now I know I've succeeded
In fiding the place I conceived
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given
to me I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given
to me I've realized the dream
And I visualized the love that
came to be i'm so alive
I'm so thankful that I've received
The answer that heaven has sent
down to me treated me kind
Sweet destiny
And I'll be eternally grateful
Prayed through the nights
So faithfully faithfully
Knowing the one that I needed
Would find me eventually
I had a vision of love

I had a vision of love

that you turn out to be

It wasn't raining yet
But it was a little misty on
That warm November night
My heart was pounding
My inner voice resounding
Begging me to turn away
But I just had to see your face
To feel alive
And then you casually walked into the room
And I was twisted in the web
Of my desire for you
(And I was twisted)
My apprehension blew away
I only wanted you
To taste my sadness
As you kissed me in the dark

Everytime I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night

And so we finished the Moet and
started feeling liberated
And I surrendered as you took me
In your arms
I was so caught up in the moment
I couldn't bear to let you go yet
So I threw caution to the wind
And started listening to my longing heart
And then you softly pressed your lips to mine
And feelings surfaced I'd suppressed
For such a long time
(And I was lifted)
And for a while I forgot
The sorrow and the pain
And melted with you as we stood
There in the rain

Everytime I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
Everytime I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night

Last night I dreamed that I
Whispered the words I love you
And touched you so very
Subtly as we were kissing goodbye
(Pretty baby- How I'm missing you)

Everytime I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
(Envision you caressing me)
And go back in time
(I go back)
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
(On the roof that rainy night)

Everytime I feel the need
(When I feel the need)
I envision you caressing me
(I envision you over and over and over again)
And go back in time
(I go back)
To relieve the splendor of you and I
(It was oh so sweet you and I)
On the rooftop that rainy night
(On that rainy night)

Everytime I feel the need
(Last night I had the strangest dream...)
I envision you caressing me
(It actually quite symbolic)
And go back in time
(As I whispered...that I loved you)
To relieve the splendor of you and I
(...very subtly)

Everytime I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night

Sorry I never told you
All I wanted to say
And now it's
too late to hold you
'Cause you've flown away
So far away
Never had I imagined
Living without your smile
Feeling
and knowing you hear me
It keeps me alive
Alive
And I know you're shining down
on me from Heaven
Like so many friends
we've lost along the way
And I know eventually
we'll be together
One sweet day
Eventually
we'll sing in heaven
Darling I never showed you
Assumed you'd always be there
But I I took your presence
for granted
But I always cared
And I miss the love we shared
And I know you're shining down
on me from Heaven
Like so many friends
we've lost along the way
And I know eventually
we'll be together
One sweet day
Eventually
we'll sing in heaven
Although the sun will
never shine the same
I'll always
look to a brighter day
Lord I know
when I lay me down to sleep
You will always
listen as I pray
And I know you're shining
down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends
we've lost along the way
And I know eventually
we'll be together
One sweet day
And I know you're shining
down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends
we've lost along the way
And I know eventually
we'll be together
One sweet day
Eventually
we'll sing in heaven
Sorry I never told you
All I wanted to say

I won't
See your smile
And I won't hear you laugh anymore
Every night
I won't see you walk through that door
'Cause time wasn't on your side
It isn't right
I can't say I love you
It's too late to tell you
But I really need you to know, oh baby
No, I'll never forget you
I'll never let you out of my heart
You will always be here with me
I'll hold on to the memories baby
Baby, can you hear me
Wherever you may be tonight
Are you near me
I need you to be by my side
'Cause I never said goodbye
It isn't right
I should have said I love you
Why didn't I just tell you
God knows I need you to know, oh baby
No, I'll never forget you
I'll never let you out of my heart
You will always be here with me
I'll hold on to the memories baby
Somewhere
I know you'll be with me
Someday
In another time
But right now you're gone
You've just vanished away
But I'll never leave you behind
No, I'll never forget you
I'll never let you out of my heart
You will always be here with me
I'll hold on to the memories
You will always be dear to me baby
No, I'll never forget you
I'll never let you out of my heart
You will always be here with me
I'll hold on to the memories
No, I'll never forget you
I'll never let you out of my heart

I am thinking of you
In my sleepless solitude tonight
If it's wrong to love you
Then my heart just won't
let me be right
Cause I've drowned in you
And I won't pull through
Without you by my side
I'd give my all to have
just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
your body next to mine
Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory
of your song
I'd give my all for your
love tonight
Baby can you feel me
Imagining I'm looking
in your eyes
I can see you clearly
Vividly emblazoned in my mind
And yet you're just so far
like a distant star
I'm wishing on tonight
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
your body next to mine
Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory
of your song
I'd give my all for your
love tonight

I'd give my all to have
just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
your body next to mine
Cause I can't go on
living in the memory
of your song
I'd give my all for your
love tonight
Give my all for your
love tonight

When I am lost
You shine a light for me and set me free
When I am low
You wash away my tears
And take me through
The loneliness
And emptiness
Through the darkest night
Somehow I survive
Through it all
When you tell me I'm the only one you need
Sweet and tenderly
And your love
Breaks away the clouds surroundin' me
All I have I want to give to thee
If I should fall
Your love is strong enough to lift me up
If I'm afraid
You chase away my fears
And take me to
A brighter place
Beyond the rain
And I feel alright
Because you're by my side
Through it all
When you tell me I'm the only one you need
Sweet and tenderly
And your love
Breaks away the clouds surrounding me
All I have I want to give to thee
You take me through
The loneliness and the emptiness
And I feel alright
'Cause you're by my side
Through it all
You tell me I'm the only one you need
Sweet and tenderly
And your love
Just breaks away the clouds surrounding me
And baby all I have I want to give to thee
Want to give you all of my love
Now and forever my love
All I have I want to give to thee

There's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
It's a long road
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand
For you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself
And that emptiness you felt
Will disappear
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you, oh, oh
Lord knows
Dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone
Tear them away, hey yeah
Hold on
There will be tomorrow
In time you'll find the way
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you
Mmm, that a hero lies in you

It was twilight
On the Fourth of July
Sparkling colors were
Strewn across the sky
And we sat close enough
That we just barely touched
While roman candles
Went soaring above us and baby
Then you put your hand in mine
And we wandered away
I was trembling inside
But I wanted to stay
Pressed against you there
and leave the world behind
On that Fourth of July
So starry eyed
On the flowery hillside
Breathless and fervid
Amid the dandelions
As it swept over me
Like the wind trough the trees
I felt you sigh with a
Sweet intensity and baby
Then you put your hand in mine
And we floated away
Delicately lay entwined
In an intimate daze
A crescent moon began to shine
And I wanted to stay
Tangled up with you among
the fireflies
On that Fourth of July
Thunder clouds Hung around
So threateningly
Ominously hovering And the sky
Opened wide Showering
Then you put your hand in mine
And we ran from the rain
Tentatively kissed goodnight
And went our separate ways
And I've never truly felt
the way that I
Felt the Fourth of July
Truly I have never felt
the same inside
Like that Fourth of July
Truly I could never feel
the same as I
Felt that Fourth of July

Oh when you walk by every night

Talking sweet and looking fine

I get kind of hectic inside

Oh baby I'm so into you

Darling if you only knew

All the things that flow through my mind

But it's just a



Sweet sweet fantasy baby

When I close my eyes

You come and take me

On and on and on

It's so deep in my daydreams

But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby



Images of rapture

Creep into me slowly

As you're going to my head

And my heart beats faster

When you take me over

Time and time and time again

But it's just a



Sweet sweet fantasy baby

When I close my eyes

You come and take me

On and on and on

It's so deep in my daydreams

But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby



Sweet sweet fantasy baby

When I close my eyes

You come and take me

On and on and on

It's so deep in my daydreams

But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby



I'm in heaven

With my boyfriend

My laughing boyfriend

There's no beginning and there is no end

Feels like I'm dreaming but I'm not sleeping



It's just a

Sweet sweet fantasy baby

When I close my eyes

You come and take me

On and on and on

It's so deep in my daydreams

But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby



Sweet sweet fantasy baby

When I close my eyes

You come and take me

On and on and on

It's so deep in my daydreams

But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby



Sweet sweet fantasy baby

Sweet sweet fantasy baby

Baby don't tell me
You miss me
You love me
Don't whisper gently
That you can't forget me
Tonight tonight
Cause I've heard it all before
Just turn away
Don't play that game
Baby I don't want to anymore
Let it all
Fade away
Don't you know the love is gone
It's too late
Everything fades away
Nothing ever stays the same
Baby
Don't tell me
You're sorry you hurt me
How many times can I give in
How many battles can you win
Oh don't beg for mercy
Tonight tonight
Cause I can't take anymore
Just turn around

Baby I don't love you like before
Let it all
Fade away
Don't you know the love is gone

Nothing ever stays the same
It's so hard for me
To let you go
Don't leave me standing in the cold
Oh baby give it one more change
I know that we can make it last
Just let me love you one more time
Cause I don't want to lose my mind
It's so hard for me to let you go
It's so hard for me to let you go
Let it all
Fade away
love is gone
It's too late
Everything fades away
Nothing ever stays the same
Nothing ever stays the same
Let it all
Fade away
love is gone
It's too late
Everything fades away

I just want someone to belong to everyday of my life
Always
So come and take me away
Dream lover come rescue me
Take me up take me down

I was wayward child
With the weight of the world
That I held deep inside
Life was a winding road
And I learned many things
Little ones shouldn't know
But I closed my eyes
Steadied my feet on the ground
Raised my head to the sky
And though time's rolled by
Still feel like that child
As I look at the moon
Maybe I grew up
A little too soon

Funny how one can learn
To grow numb to the madness
And block it away
I left the worst unsaid
Let it all dissipate
And I try to forget
But I closed my eyes
Steadied my feet on the ground
Raised my head to the sky
And though time's rolled by
Still feel like that child
As I look at the moon
Maybe I grew up
A little too soon

Nearing the edge
Obvious I almost
Fell right over
A part of me
Will never be quite able
To feel stable
That woman child falling inside
Was on the verge of fading
Thankfully I
Woke up in time

Guardian angel I
Sail away on an ocean
With you by my side
Orange clouds roll by
They burn into your image
And you're still alive
But I closed my eyes
Steadied my feet on the ground
Raise my head to the sky
And though time's rolls by
Still feel like that child
As I look at the moon
Maybe I grew up
A little too soon

When you love someone so deeply
They become your life
It's easy to succumb to over
whelming fears inside
Blindly I imagined I could
Keep your under glass
Now I understand to hold you
I must open up my hands
And watch you rise
Spread you wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly
I have learned that beauty
Has to flourish in the light
Wild horses run unbridled
Or their spirit dies
You have given me the courage
To be all that I can
And truly feel your heart
will lead you back to me when you're
when you're ready to land
Spread you wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly Butterfly
I can't pretend these tears
Aren't over flowing steadily
I can't prevent this hurt from
Almost overt aking me
But I will stand and say goodbye
stand say goodbye
For you'll never be mine
Until you know the way it
feels to fly
Spread you wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
I will know your mind
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly
Spread you wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly
So flutter through the sky
butterfly
fly
spread your wings and fly
Butterfly

[Layzie Bone]
Don't Breakdown yet it's over, over
Don't Breakdown yet it's over, over
Don't Breakdown yet it's over, over
Don't Breakdown yet it's over
[Krayzie Bone (1)]
(Mariah Carey humming in background)
Steady breaking me on down
Break breakdown
Steady breaking me on down
Break breakdown
Steady breaking me on down
[Mariah Carey]
You called yesterday
To basically say
That you care for me but
That you're just not in love
Immediately I pretended to be
Feeling similarly
In that you'd ever leave
I was ok to just walk away from the
One thing that's unyielding and sacred to me
[Chorus: sung by Mariah Carey; Krayzie Bone singing 1 in background]
Well I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm
Slowly losing my mind
Underneath the guise of smile
Gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel
And I lie convincingly
Cause I don't want to reveal
The fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise
Til I go home at night
And turn down all the lights
And then I breakdown and cry
[Mariah Carey]
So what do you do when
Somebody you're so devoted to
Suddenly just stops loving you
And it seems they haven't got a clue
Of the pain that rejection is putting you through
Do you cling to your pride
And sing 'I Will Survive'
(Krayzie Bone in background: Gotta get control and roll roll roll on)
Do you lash out and say
How dare you leave this way
Do you hold in vain
As they just slip away
[Chorus]
[Wish Bone]
Gonna break you down, down, down, only if you let it (Don't let it)
Everyday crazy situations rocking my mind trying to break me down
But I won't let it forget it
If you feel the same way that I do
Then let me hear y'all all sing too
Sing, it's al-right, it's alright, it's alright yeah
Hoping for the sun, but it looks like rain
B-O-N-E, but it's still the same
Came this far, but it's been a long road
Troubles gonna come but we gotta stay strong, hold on, on
[Krayzie Bone]
Aw, yeah, I often feel the pressures, y'all
But nevertheless Krayzie won't fall
It's over, it's ending here, here
I said it's over. It's ending here, here
So I'll be on my way
And maybe we can meet up in the future one day
But for now I'm bailing, bailing
Bailing!, baby gotta get up, can't take no more
I'm headed for the door
Come and take a look into this humble eye
Tell me if we lived a lie
Would I, should you now
[Layzie Bone]
Every new day is a test for me
So I just pray to the Lord for him to bless me, please
There's struggles I'm going through lately
Breaks me down, set me free
Let me be, let me be
Who else do we have to rely on
Whose shoulder can a thug go cry on
Can't forget my Bible
While you look into my eyes
Won't underestimate this soldier story
I'ma tell you right now I'ma stand up
Wrong if I let my lead bust
Pac said keep your head up
Don't let this world get the best of you
All my struggles, I'm through
If it's over, over, over
Don't breakdown yet it's over
[Chorus]
(with Mariah Carey singing in background)
[Chorus]
(With Mariah Carey singing and Krayzie Bone singing 1 all in background)
Cry, cry (Break break down)
Cry, cry (Steady breaking me on down)
Cry, cry (Break break down)
Cry, cry (Steady breaking me on down)

If you're lonely
And need a friend
And troubles seem like
They never end
Just remember to keep the faith
And love will be there to light the way
Anytime you need a friend
I will be here
You'll never be alone again
So don't you fear
Even if you're miles away
I'm by your side
So don't you ever be lonely
Love will make it alright
When the shadows are closing in
And your spirit diminishing
Just remember you're not alone
And love will be there
To guide you home
Anytime you need a friend
I will be here
You'll never be alone again
So don't you fear
Even if you're miles away
I'm by your side
So don't you ever be lonely
Love will make it alright
If you just believe in me
I will love you endlessly
Take my hand
Take me into your heart
I'll be there forever baby
I won't let go
I'll never let go
Anytime you need a friend
I will be here
You'll never be alone again
So don't you fear
Even if you're miles away
I'm by your side
So don't you ever be lonely
It's alright
It's alright, it's alright
Yes, you know it's alright
Oh, don't ever feel it
Oh, I'm by your side don't you ever be lonely
Yeah, anytime
Oh, you'll never be alone

It's 2 11 and I'm stressing
Watching Tv in my hotel suite
I check my service
every second
At 2 10 you still hadn't
called me
So I'm gonna leave
my cell phone turned on
in my purse by the bed
And before I fall asleep
I guess I'll just check
my machine
Again and again because I'm
Obsessing on you
I wanna be your babydoll
Wrap me up nice and tight
Love me through the night
Come lay me down
Enfold me in your arms
Cover me with velvet kisses
Rock me on and on
And whisper softly to me
You wanna be my babydoll
Zoning out thinking about
You and me between the sheets
I want to get intimate
But you're not within
my reach
So I'll have a
little more wine
And I'll try to drink you
Out of my head
And I'll lay awake awhile
'Til I'm high enough I can
Forget about you until
I wake up again
I wanna be your babydoll
Wrap me up nice and tight
Love me through the night
Come lay me down
Enfold me in your arms
Cover me with velvet kisses
Rock me on and on
And whisper softly to me
You wanna be my babydoll
Slipping into dreams
I feel my love surround you
my subconscious seems
To weave itself around you
Do you care for me
Beyond idolization
Tell me how you feel
But don't keep me at bay
Cause I won't be waiting long
I wanna be your babydoll
Wrap me up nice and tight
Love me through the night
Come lay me down
Enfold me in your arms
Cover me with velvet kisses
Rock me on and on
And whisper softly to me
You wanna be my babydoll
I wanna be your babydoll
Wrap me up nice and tight
Love me through the night
Come lay me down
Enfold me in your arms
Cover me with velvet kisses
Rock me on and on
And whisper softly to me
You wanna be my babydoll
my babydoll
Rock me on on and on

I wanna be your babydoll

I wanna be your babydoll

I wanna be your babydoll

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
Yeah
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need (and I)
Don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking there upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy with a toy on Christmas Day
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, baby
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow (and I)
I'm just gonna keep on waiting underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it to the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to hear those magic reindeer click
'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Oh, baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby
Oh-oh, all the lights are shining so brightly everywhere (so brightly, baby)
And the sound of children's laughter fills the air (oh, oh, yeah)
And everyone is singing (oh, yeah)
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? (Yeah, oh)
Won't you please bring my baby to me?
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just wanna see my baby standing right outside my door
Oh, I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Oh, baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas (all I really want) is you, baby
All I want (I want) for Christmas (all I really want) is you, baby
